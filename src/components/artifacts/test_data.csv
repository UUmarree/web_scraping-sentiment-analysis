1577,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather
It is a very tragic and logical story that teaches you the important of something that unfortunately has lost its meaning in the present day : the family<br/><br/>Father (Vito) who lived alone and came as an expatriate from the city of Corleone, and the most important thing for him was the family and died among his family and the people who loved him<br/><br/>And his son Michael became the leader of the mafia, but he did not care about the family, and he was inside a life dedicated to him and wanted to influence it, so his daughter paid his selfish wish and died alone in the city where his father was born, the city of Corleone<br/><br/>What the movie wants to do is not a mafia dialogue, and this is what it is, it is the film that really communicates the importance of family and this is noticeable in the difference between Michael and Vito with their family<br/><br/>Vito: A man who does not spare time for his family is not a man<br/><br/>Michael killed his brother and deprived his daughter of the one she loved and forbade his son from singing and lied to his wife and told her that she was doing an abortion and widowed his sister<br/><br/>And of course we do not forget the great song &quot;Speak Softly, Love&quot; is a jewel and very tragic."

5639,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is one of the best movies ever. A lot of powerful men. Also great actors who play in this movie. This a movie I can watch over and over again. I recommend this movie. Although the movie is about gangsters, there&#39;s still a lesson to be learned from this movie. There is a price to pay for being a criminal. Every good dog has its good and bad days."
4653,tt0068646,The Godfather,The godfather is for me the best movie of all. Al Pacino&#39;s performance is impeccable. The direction of Francis Ford Coppola shows what a great director he is. A masterpiece.
2646,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Lately it seems, &quot;The Godfather&quot; has had a ubiquitous presence on the cable channels; not a week goes by where I don&#39;t see it listed playing at one time or another. For some reason I&#39;ve never considered watching the film from start to finish since the first time I saw it during it&#39;s theatrical release back in 1972 - until today. There&#39;s a good reason why. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ever been another movie to stay with me the way this one has over the past four decades. I remember virtually everything about it, even the minor scenes like the hit on driver Paulie and the &#39;sleeps with the fishes&#39; calling card regarding Luca Brasi. Also the names - Clemenza, Barzini, Solozzo, Tartaglia; Moe Green too, even though he wasn&#39;t Italian. So effective was the magic of the film that I still have to check every now and then to see if Abe Vigoda (Tessio) is still alive (like I did today), only to find out that yes he is, still going strong at nearly ninety! <br/><br/>Quite simply, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is, with no pun intended, the godfather of all the great gangster films, dating all the way back to 1931&#39;s &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and &quot;Public Enemy&quot;. For Marlon Brando, it was the quintessential performance of American cinema, so nuanced and mesmerizing that it&#39;s impossible to forget. The movie in fact was so powerful that it literally made overnight stars of it&#39;s supporting players - Pacino, Caan and Duvall.<br/><br/>There has been enough written about the film that I don&#39;t need to get into the story itself. I&#39;ll content myself with mentioning the scenes that literally blow me away, then and now - Sonny&#39;s job on Carlo in the middle of the neighborhood (that last kick is priceless), the mob hit on Sonny in the causeway, Michael&#39;s restaurant rubout of Solozzo and McCluskey, and the way Michael handled Tom Hagen&#39;s ouster as consigliere. The cherry topping of course is the baptismal scene, Michael renouncing Satan as he does the devil&#39;s work of eliminating the heads of the families who stood in opposition to the Corleones. Every scene of the movie is staged perfectly, yet rendered effortlessly as if it were just another day in the life.<br/><br/>It would have been too easy to use the classic tag line in my summary above, you know, the one about making an offer that can&#39;t be refused. With &quot;The Godfather&quot;, it seems that every scene is larger than life, with the total picture being even greater than the sum of it&#39;s parts. So I&#39;ll content myself with a recommendation that seems apropos by quoting Clemenza after his man whacked Paulie - &quot;Leave the gun. Take the cannoli&quot;. For cinema fans, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is all cannoli."
533,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,Just watch it! if u watch this movie you r gonna get really strong lesson for this life ..
3715,tt0068646,The Godfather,Epic film. no other movies like this come out. the drama the entanglement was fantastic
2141,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;keep your friends close, but your enemies closer&quot;, &quot;i&#39;ll make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot;, &quot;luca brasi sleeps with the fishes&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t over-estimate the power of forgiveness&quot;, &quot;if anything in this life is certain, if history&#39;s taught us anything, its that you can kill anyone&quot; etc. These words are still in my mind."
1454,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema."
160,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I&#39;ve watched great movies. The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy (1999), The Green Mile, Silence of the Lambs, E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc. Inasmuch as they are outrageously great, none of them come close to this absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>In a world where there&#39;s so much despair, so much crime, so much death and destruction, you would think there&#39;s no light at the end of the tunnel. But nope. This movie reminds us that, despite the trials and tribulations we face everyday, there&#39;s one thing that cannot be toppled....
HOPE.<br/><br/>&quot;To live without hope is to cease to live.&quot; - Fyodor Dostoyevsky
&quot;Get busy living.... or get busy dying!&quot; - Andy Dufresne<br/><br/>This movie, in my own opinion, is the greatest movie of all time."
2522,tt0068646,The Godfather,Mafia people so cool they make me wanna buy italian pizza so great so amazing sheesh.
5630,tt0068646,The Godfather,This film will always be a classic to me. Best acting and a quality production.
383,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This movie is so complete. Some say it&#39;s too long; those people are wrong. Every scene matters, every scene is developing the story and the story it tells is beautiful. The filmmakers tell that story in the perfect way. It is hard to find something wrong with this film. I never got bored from start to finish. All the actors were believable and gave great performances. Truly one of the best films of all time."
5557,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In each aspect of film making, this movie just keeps delivering, theres a lot of people that by this being an &quot;old movie&quot; they wont enjoy it, but this is just not true... you will enjoy every aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>The acting makes you feel every character, you get emotionally invested, maybe you dont want to watch a long movie, but trust me... this wont feel long at all, with this story-telling it will make you see that this isn&#39;t just a movie you watch, this is a movie that truly makes you feel something.<br/><br/>I wish I didn&#39;t watch it cause I just want to see it all over again, I want to forget every single scene just to feel what i felt."
4157,tt0068646,The Godfather,"An American classic, and one of the greatest film&#39;s ever made. Director Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s masterpiece, based on Mario Puzo&#39;s bestselling novel starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. The film chronicles a ten year span (1945 to 1955) in the life of the Italian-American Corleone crime family of New York City.<br/><br/>It&#39;s hard to find a moment in the film that isn&#39;t great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. The greatest gangster film ever made. Coppola offers a rich and layered look at family and does so with an incredible cast and a meticulous amount of detail<br/><br/>&quot;must see&quot; masterpiece."
1835,tt0068646,The Godfather,Its a good movie but it doesnt deserve the place for second best rated movie. I have seen much much better movies with 7 rate or 8.

434,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"To call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all. This is a film that when I watched it the first time I couldn&#39;t believe how good it was.  I expected a film that would pass the time by, and I got a film that I could identify with.  If you are feeling sad, and you think the world&#39;s a rubbish place, this fills you with hope.  I love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison, and then the music kicks in, it makes you feel awe-inspired.  <br/><br/>The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good. <br/><br/>
The film and book reciprocated the message &#39;Hope Springs Eternal&#39;, which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better, things might change for us, and hope never dies. <br/><br/>
I think, when Tim Robbins speaks about music, how you can never take it away, because it&#39;s in your head.  If I have a rubbish day at work, then it&#39;s true that music just lifts you, which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison (this of example of piece of script, which means, so much). The movie uses music to it&#39;s full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters.  <br/><br/>This film cannot replicated, because the film is a piece of art, the Director wanted to make money, but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something, that had some effect on you after the movie was over. The movie has no bad points it&#39;s what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you nether been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience.  The lines delivered, will always be remembered &#39;Get busy living, or get busy dying&#39; (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live).  This will live in my memories forever, not like the sorry cash-ins of movies.  <br/><br/>This is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is, but words just seem so little to explain the brilliance of this film."
63,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Last week, I had seen &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; and I feel it is one of the best movies ever made, especially in these hard to entertain folks at the movies for $10 a seat times. I couldn&#39;t understand how some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that film.<br/><br/>That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.<br/><br/>
In the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times. Three of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine Coke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn&#39;t warm up to this film. Robbins and Freeman&#39;s acting was good, but I guess the story wasn&#39;t original -- or surprising to me. I just didn&#39;t care about these guys, nor anyone else. It&#39;s prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I get that concept. Sometimes you&#39;re released after serving time, sometimes you&#39;re not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of High School or college I guess. I just don&#39;t care about those folks no matter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn&#39;t care about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing. Snooze.<br/><br/>First I thought, I might not be a big &quot;prison&quot; entertainment fan, but then I remembered one of my favorite films is &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (which I thought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (which was more on King&#39;s level than this) and I actually sat through a few seasons of HBO&#39;s &quot;Oz&quot; which was gritty and scary, to say the least. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If you&#39;re wondering, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; is another.)<br/><br/>The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who didn&#39;t like &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, I find myself here at &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, and now I am able to stand where they were -- for a moment -- in the minority.<br/><br/>All things are not wonderful to all people.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s....a good thing."
2101,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie, especially the whole series was great. The whole thing about the process of how they work. Also the hierarchy and the story is amazing. How they focus on having each person have their jobs to do. How each actor gives an amazing performance. How they try to take control of each families territory. Having to come together for something series. Especially how they focus on family and being organized. They definitely put a lot of work on this film and the others. Each one comes around 3 hours long but they are definitely worth watching. This movie and the others gave me the urge to watch any other mafia movie that comes out."
4298,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Violence, Emotions, Violence.
Nothing than celebration of the pure violence motivated by pseudo social reasons.
No thanks.

5725,tt0068646,The Godfather,The godfather trilogy is best movie of all time.everything in godfather is perfect. from directing to acting and soundtrack and everythig...
2374,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The 70s is my favourite decade of films, a new breed of cinema began and it started with The Godfather and ended with Apocalypse Now, both directed by the master, Coppolla!!! In-between, we had many films, ranging from innovative thrillers to a stunning comic book picture(Superman), from horrors to romance etc etc.<br/><br/>Guys and gals, the 1970s was and always will be the decade when cinema had taken a massive change. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the 40s, 50s, 60s, 80s and 90s, but the decade in question just took a bigger step.<br/><br/>The Godfather is storytelling at its finest, it just can&#39;t get any better (actually it does in Godfather part2), this film is stunning, amazing, breathtaking and near-perfection.<br/><br/>The performances are stunning, every person in the picture is amazing, they really drew me into their world. Marlon Brando is amazing, no one could&#39;ve made this role work. On paper, Brando&#39;s role is simple but the execution could only be done by Marlon.<br/><br/>The masterful story-telling crafted by Mario Puzo and Francis Coppolla hit the right notes. Francis directs each scene with stunning authority. The production values are breathtaking, very authentic. Every person on the film deserves a hand. And let&#39;s not forget the unforgettable score by Nina Rota.<br/><br/>I won&#39;t tell you about the story because only the film can do it justice. Just watch it. Always worth watching every year, a film which will take multiple viewings to understand all characters.<br/><br/>The saga continues in The Godfather part 2.<br/><br/>This is A MASTERPIECE!"
1071,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,what an amazing and motivating movie never get bored at any part of it. the music is so amazing and have you in a great movie mode. the screenplay was perfect you can never be bored from it or feel that any part wasn&#39;t in its place. Morgan freeman as great as usual never get bored from him knows when to make you laugh and when to get shocked or excited. also Tim Robbins I can&#39;t forget him since I first watched his movie Nothing to Lose with Martin Lawrence and the great amount of laughing and sorry you feel with along the movie. this movie for me is one of the iconic movies over history which I have a good memories for it and loves it so much.
2594,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a strong contender for the best film ever made. I&#39;d argue that it is the ultimate gangster movie.<br/><br/>Don&#39;t worry about the nearly three-hour runtime; you won&#39;t even notice the time passing, it flies by.<br/><br/>The production values are astounding, with a visual appeal that remains impressive throughout. At around fifty years old, it outshines many modern films.<br/><br/>With performances by Brando, Pacino, and Castellano, among others, the acting is phenomenal.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re considering a hard copy, I recommend the Blu-ray version; it&#39;s sharper than the DVD, and the difference is noticeable.<br/><br/>This film has had a significant influence over the years and will always be one of the greatest. 10/10."
5540,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I sometimes wish I was alive in 1972 so I could see The Godfather in theaters. Some of the best cinematography and editing was produced in this movie. It tells the story of the mafia from the inside. It was amazing how the movie made you admire Don Corleone even though he was essentially evil. During the movie, the audience really doesn&#39;t see much it can disapprove of. No women are involved in prostitution, no lives are being ended by compulsive gambling, and no theft rings. In fact, the only real person outside the mob who is corrupt is a police officer with a significant speaking role. Brando is great with many memorable and quotable lines, and Al Pacino&#39;s performance in comparison to Brando&#39;s shouldn&#39;t be ranked to much further behind. A great ensemble of a cast and supporting players. Well done!"
4428,tt0068646,The Godfather,"A Great Movie to watch.<br/><br/>Need not to say more about the great actor Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>Long time ago read this story of Mario Puzo and fascinated by it.<br/><br/>Again seen it in a visual form. Great portrait of the characters from the story.<br/><br/>I liked the scene most( yes, liked other scenes also) the hospital scene and with the gathering of the whole clan of the relatives.<br/><br/>Al Pacino also did a very good job in the movie.<br/><br/>So, I personally recommend this movie a must watch.<br/><br/>A wonderful movie to watch. I personally like the movie."
674,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"A couple of &#39;bests&#39; for this film; the best King adaptation ahead of Misery and Stand by Me, and in the conversation for one of the best films of all time.<br/><br/>Shawshank has stood the test of time since the sacrilegious Oscars debacle of 1995. Two films should have beaten Forrest and it is line ball between Pulp Fiction and Andy Dufresne&#39;s epic prison sentence.<br/><br/>Robbins and Freeman have never been better as Andy and Red, whose non-sexual love story is the unique difference that sets the film apart from the usual prison movie cliches.<br/><br/>It can be hokey, too long by 30 minutes, and perhaps even a bit preachy. But it is incredibly well made, and very entertaining. 9/10."
1742,tt0068646,The Godfather,This is more than a gangster movie this is a pure masterpiece.
2753,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The few &quot;perfect&quot; films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola&#39;s revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern &quot;cinema&quot;, Coppola&#39;s The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota&#39;s breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola&#39;s very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather."
3343,tt0068646,The Godfather,"While some may claim showing the scenes in reverse is just an annoying trick to make a simple plot confusing and add a plethora of twists, I wholeheartedly disagree. Any good story teller knows it&#39;s not what you say, but how you say it.<br/><br/>By playing the scenes in reverse you experience the confusion Lenny undergoes throughout the film. Showing some of the scenes in chronological order (BTW, the use of B&amp;W instead of color to make the time distinction was ingenious) creates suspense which builds as the two time lines converge. The somewhat rushed pace (compared to a written format) doesn&#39;t give you enough time to adequately analyze the events during the movie. This has two advantages: firstly you&#39;re going to talk about it after you leave the theater adding to experience immensely, and secondly you don&#39;t have time to think about what has happened (will happen) so you&#39;re experience better follows that of Lenny."
5213,tt0068646,The Godfather,This is the movie which is force me to sit continuously till the completion.
2164,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a film that can be easily described not as a gangster flick, but more like an opera.  We see the struggle of one family trying to run the business in a world where rival families will do anything to muscle them out of the way.  Al Pacino is the doomed Michael who will one day take over the family business.  Try as he might to avoid it, it is his destiny. The cast is outstanding, the script is top notch and what other film could spend the entire first forty minutes at a wedding?  Watch this with the equally great Godfather Part II and the follow up Godfather III.  Some will say that Godfather III is the weakest one of them all.  I say it is a perfect ending to an opera of one of the greatest gangster sagas of all time."
3965,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s masterful cinematic adaptation of Mario Puzo&#39;s &#39;The Godfather&#39; (the book version was first published in 1969, 3 years before the film) has received so much universal praise, it is almost difficult to add more stars to its already shimmering gold laurel. It has famously won 3 Oscars, including one for &#39;Best Picture&#39; and &#39;Best Actor in a Leading Role&#39; by Marlon Brando. But besides the awards, critical acclaim, and universal appreciation of Ford Coppola&#39;s masterpiece, this film should be easily considered as one of the most iconic films of all time as well.<br/><br/>So one question seems to ask itself: &quot;Is &#39;The Godfather&#39; the best film ever made?&quot; The great and celebrated American filmmaker Stanley Kubrick (1928-1999) seemed to think so. According to the &#39;Trivia&#39; section here on IMDB, Kubrick thought that the film had the best cast ever and could be the best film ever made. A lot of people agree with this statement as well. &#39;The Godfather&#39; is not only ranked as the second most popular film of all time on IMDB by popular vote, it is also one of the best rated at a whopping 9.2 (as of 20/08/2025)!<br/><br/>So, while it is hard to say with absolute certainly that &#39;The Godfather&#39; is the best film ever made, the overwhelming positive popular critical reception this film has garnered around the world all indicate that it is a film of immense class and quality. What Francis Ford Coppola has created in his iconic, faithful, and outstanding cinematic adaptation of Mario Puzo&#39;s original novel is nothing short of legendary as its awards and universal critical acclaim speak for themselves."
83,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Why do you like this so much? It steals directly from every other GOOD prison movie I&#39;ve ever seen: The Great Escape, Escape from Alcatraz, Midnight Express, you name it. Because it allows the hero to be raped it&#39;s somehow brave or profound or heaven forbid realistic. Far from it folks. The work of hacks, only the MAIN performances are redeemable. How &#39;bout that warden, quite a 3 dimensional character that one. As are all the peripherals. Its bad, but in an average hollywood way. Of course it&#39;s overblown but it entertains decent enough in that much. Nothing memorable, infact I&#39;d have forgotten it totally if it weren&#39;t for the persistant and oh so undeserved praise heaped upon it. But hey if it does it for you more power to you. Just don&#39;t talk about it&#39;s &quot;power&quot; in front of me, I may puke."
4581,tt0068646,The Godfather,I made my day by watching &quot;The Godfather&quot;. When i was finished with it i just thought i have now watched The Godfather of all movies. The acting was spectacular. I could not have imagined a Drama movie could be so fun to have watched.
2173,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The USA have reached a point of no return in 1972 that is going to lead them to their final defeat in Vietnam and their tremendous decline in the world. At this moment too the consumer&#39;s society has produced a new need in western societies, the need for some artificial paradise that could compensate the materialistic narrow-mindedness of modern life, the lack of spirituality in mass consumption. This paper tiger of a paradise is brought by drugs. The drug market explodes, and first of all in the USA. The mafia is confronted to this problem in New York and elsewhere. The older generation of the Godfather refuses this evolution and that brings some kind of confrontation among the five families or clans and the police of course that tries to put their hands on the profit without soiling their fingers. At the same time the Godfather is brought to realising that he has to let a younger generation take over. First an agreement is reached about drugs : drug trafficking will be accepted but regulated. No drugs to minors and in schools, and drugs in priority to the dark ones, the blacks in an attempt to keep this « cancer » contained in the most hated community in the US. This though is not enough to pacify the streets of New York. The Godfather&#39;s death is the signal for one of his surviving sons, appointed guardian of the business by the godfather himself, to take over. It is done in the most typical method of the mafia : the five families are decimated at their heads, including the Corleone family. The new Godfather eliminates his brother in law who is responsible for the death of one of the brothers. Brutal, ruthless, pacifying for sure for a while but the promise that with time vengeance will bring strife again. The depicting of power in a feudal system like that of the Sicilian mafia based on the signoria, on the absolute autonomy of each family and their right to defend their territories and their interests by any means including killing, including children and women. Francis Ford Coppola takes a very visible pleasure in this depiction that he complacently shows in its very minute details of cruelty and viciousness.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine &amp; University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"
588,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,This film is it 10/10. Great masterpiece of a prison movie.
729,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I cant find another word to describe this movie. AMAZING! The title is so horrible and i never expected i would watch it for 30 minutes. But when i saw it, i realised the big mistake in not watching it earlier.<br/><br/>The movie has a beautiful plot set over 20 years. Every part of the movie has a bearing on the ending. And never did i imagine such a spectacular ending. Not many movies can boast of a suspense of such a kind. This movie is not a thriller, nor is it adventure; but it is a desire of a Man who lives on Hope and who paves his own Destiny. Shawshank Redemption leaves you with a elated mind and a moral that it is fear that holds you back and Hope that carries you forward. I have only one message for IMDb viewers. Just watch Shawshank Redemption. Do not avoid it because the title is bad or else you too will have the same wretched feeling that i had today. Wish i had seen it when i did have an opportunity a decade ago. Well.. sometimes, cinema is like this. You go for titles, stars and big buck films and come back home disappointed. But Shawshank Redemption proves that all you need is a excellent script, a good director and some thespians like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins."
5295,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I&#39;ve heard much about this film, but haven&#39;t got around to watching until today.<br/><br/>The film follows the life of Don Vito Corleone, the head of the Mafia Family who decides to hand over his empire to his youngest son, Michael. He decision, however, backfires as it puts the lives of those he loves in grave danger.<br/><br/>I found the film to be not bad at all, it has some good moments in it &amp; is reasonably watchable. But, the story-line is a bit hard to follow &amp; of course the main issue is the pacing &amp; overly bloated runtime of 2 hours &amp; 45 minutes. I do think the film is heavily overrated, it&#39;s not bad, but come on, 10/10? Nah, it&#39;s 5/10 at most.<br/><br/>As I said, the story was a bit hard to follow &amp; the dialogue didn&#39;t help matters either. You found yourself trying to understand what was happening for the most part. So for that, that&#39;s why I find the film to be overrated &amp; not half as great as people make out. The film is also a little dated too, but that can&#39;t helped given it&#39;s nearly 51 years old. But still, it could be a fact that back then in 1972, it was more of a hit &amp; hasn&#39;t aged well.<br/><br/>The action was a little few &amp; far between, but was pretty good. The action sequences &amp; gore were well done enough, despite the gore being too red, but the fights, explosions &amp; gun shot outs were good nonetheless along with the other action sequences. But the action could&#39;ve been more &amp; a bit more in your face. The music was good &amp; haunting like, not to mention memorable. The actors done well with their parts also.<br/><br/>Overall, it&#39;s a not bad film, but heavily overrated &amp; a little dated. Yeah, the action in terms of fights, gore, gun shoot outs &amp; explosions were well executed along with the actors in this flick. But the film drags out for 165 minutes &amp; has poor pacing with scenes that could&#39;ve been shorten down or cut out entirely. The story &amp; dialogue were hard to follow as the film plodded along, maybe a rewatch is in order? But, it&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s not ace or worthy of a 10/10 rating that&#39;s for sure.<br/><br/>5/10."
311,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"When i first watched it i like it at once,it is really a good film.i can learn a lot of things from it.<br/><br/>¡°The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, which is a movie about time, patience and loyalty - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.<br/><br/>The story is narrated by &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. <br/><br/>But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he&#39;s in for murder. He&#39;s apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society - who is strong, who is not - and the measured passage of time. <br/><br/>Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized - that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside. <br/><br/>Red&#39;s narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he&#39;s been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden&#39;s office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden&#39;s ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he&#39;s doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system. <br/><br/>There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison - and us, too - is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.<br/><br/>The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a &quot;prison drama&quot; in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word &quot;redemption&quot; is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King&#39;s work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man&#39;s life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. <br/><br/>The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own. <br/><br/>Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end. <br/><br/>&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.<br/><br/>All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy for everybody to watch, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing , maybe the best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us thinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that there has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage, because every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of freedom. I think everyone should remember this , everyone of us are covered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no matter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a good thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
327,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Simply wonderful.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt the greatest film ever. Incredible story, acting, cinematography, soundtrack, and a genuinely satisfying ending. But more importantly, it speaks to people on a deeper level. That&#39;s the reason that stands the test of time. A message of hope and perseverance. Fantastic."
2259,tt0068646,The Godfather,Overrated movie. not even in my top 1000 movie. I feelt so sleeping while watchin it and felt that I just wasted two hours watching it and decided to stop
1060,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"What is this movie is doing in the top ten? Its a good movie. By good I mean - you go to see it and you walk out saying - that was a good movie. Then you may watch it again because you remember enjoying it the first time. On the third viewing you are beginning to tire of it and the characters seem more contrived and you begin to see how the script has some flaws. Still - all and all - its better than most. A great movie (and there are many) is a movie that no matter how many times you watch it you marvel at the script - the performances - the music - all the things we love about the movies. The Shawshank Redemption doesn&#39;t come close. Well made, good performances, but not great and not deserving of being on ANY top ten movie list of all time."
2398,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I have watched hundred of movies in the last 10 years and my all time favourite is/was &quot;The shawshank redemption&quot; i have always seen it as the best movie ever made but after watching &quot;godfather&quot; i just don&#39;t know anymore which one should be in top for me, one thing i&#39;m sure of right now is that i have 2 favourite best movies instead of one."
1381,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I usually hate popular movies(pulp fiction, titanic, forest gump). So I was very sceptical when I sat down to watch the currently 4th ranked movie on the imdb. What can i say, I agree, this movie gets a 10, while some things are hard to believe(his escape) the range of this movie makes it easy to ignore. There is a lot of depth here. You get to see all the characters grow and age, you really get drawn in to the plot. It shows how brutal prison can be. And how dependent on the system one can become. Another minor thing I didn&#39;t like was how after &quot;The Sisters&quot; leader was beaten and transfered the prison seem to be a utopia except for the guards. There should have been at least a little inmate-to-inmate brutality shown.<br/><br/>A great addition to your DVD collection."
1182,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; or &quot;Shawshank&quot; as I&#39;m sure it&#39;s said to death in the film is an elongated short story that just &#39;lingers&#39; from one hour to the next. There&#39;s no real &#39;charm&#39; to the film except of course &#39;dry wit&#39; from Red as if it&#39;s the gospel according to Red. He basically plugs Andy the entire movie as if he&#39;s his agent. &quot;Now Andy this&quot; and &quot;Andy that&quot;. Not to mention a walking brochure for penitentiaries &quot;Shawshank this&quot; and &quot;Shawhank that&quot; his gospel just never lets up.<br/><br/>Now Tim Robbins was perfectly cast for about 5 minutes playing &#39;the babe in the woods&#39; who &quot;looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over&quot; a &quot;tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass&quot;. But once nothing seems to break him, its definitely a part for Mel Gibson. Tim Robbins didn&#39;t have the &#39;acting chops&#39; to bring the &#39;required depth&#39; to this character. Fortunate for Robbins in post production Morgan Freeman saved his ass with extensive voice overs. Most people think this was premeditated but &#39;the truth&#39; is Robbins gave such a wooden performance it was necessary.<br/><br/>Most people think this isn&#39;t your average prison drama ether because its not about violence and melodrama. But &#39;the truth&#39; is this film is no better than your TV movie of the week that features a &#39;prison escape&#39;. The whole &#39;poster thing&#39; couldn&#39;t be more &#39;implausible&#39; if an elephant hang from a cliff by a daisy. Don&#39;t let me get started on how he just happened to have the cell on the end ether! The music was &#39;elevator music&#39; at best. The only time I even took notice was when they actually featured it in the plot And even then if I&#39;d heard it id have personally punctured my eardrums. Why the &#39;sound&#39; was nominated for an academy award is beyond me. If it weren&#39;t for packaging and distribution this film would be a made for TV movie. Which it was if you consider its box office taking against home rental.<br/><br/>The entire cast reeked &#39;cartoon&#39;. You have your &#39;evil&#39; warden with his &#39;religion&#39;. You have your &#39;mean&#39; guards you &#39;grow to love&#39;. Not to mention &#39;the kid&#39;, &#39;the old guy&#39;, &#39;the black guy&#39; and &#39;the guys&#39;. The prison was so stereotypical it even had &#39;fags&#39;. Some other failings of this &#39;pathetic&#39; movie. The dialog was &#39;harebrained&#39;. If it was supposed to fascinate, well, it &#39;failed&#39;. The manner in which the mini stories unfolded was &#39;not stimulating&#39;. His ability to get beers and do taxes in particular &#39;sucked&#39;.<br/><br/>In short this film &#39;sucked&#39;. Worst film &#39;since&#39;, well since ever!"
691,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"What can I say about Shawshank that hasn&#39;t already been said? This is one of my all-time favourite movies, and I&#39;ve seen it maybe a dozen times but I keep going back for more.<br/><br/>Tim Robbins is cast perfectly as Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to prison, but who somehow never quite lets prison break his spirit.<br/><br/>In a sense, this can be compared to Cuckoo&#39;s Nest; Andy&#39;s effect on the prison and his fellow prisoners is much like MacMurphy&#39;s effect on the mental patients. And Warden Norton has a Nurse Ratched-like character, full of self-righteousness and a kind of indignation at having to &quot;teach them a lesson&quot;.<br/><br/>Simple story or not, this movie is uplifting and inspiring. Wonderfully acted and directed, Shawshank&#39;s status as a classic is well-deserved."
2096,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The year was 1972. Francis Ford Coppola was in the beginning of this career, and he was only in the process of proving himself as a director. Little did he know, that he was going to direct a movie which would go down as possibly THE most beloved and acclaimed film of all time. The movie was &quot;The Godfather&quot;. It became the highest grossing film of the year 1972, and of all time (in 1972)! It won 3 Oscars: Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Albert S. Ruddy). Unfortunately, Coppola did not take home the gold for directing, nor did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall or James Caan for their brilliant supporting roles! But Oscars really doesn&#39;t matter, the movie still stands as a piece of cinematic brilliance! <br/><br/>The Godfather tells a relatively simple tale: Michael Corleone (Pacino) is son of the powerful mafia don Vito Corleone (Brando). Michael recently returned from the WW2, and he wants nothing to do with the &quot;family business&quot;. Vito doesn&#39;t want that either, but after a chain of events, Michael is forced to rise as the new family don, in order to protect his family and allies from downfall. The movie doesn&#39;t pretend to be something it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a simple plot, it&#39;s one we can all understand and it&#39;s still en epic gangster movie! And that&#39;s the other thing about the film: it&#39;s very epic in scope! All the locations, all the props, all the actors, etc. It all comes together to create something magical! <br/><br/>Al Pacino keys in an amazing performance as Michael, the son who must protect his family! At first eye-drop one could call his performance &quot;low-key&quot;. But it&#39;s merely an observation of the characters calmness, subtlety and his cold nature, that transforms into a calculating, ruthless and chilling persona. Apparently, Pacino approached the role with this thought. For my money, this was an Academy Award-worthy performance. Marlon Brando is equally impressing as Vito Corelone. His performance is calm, determined and calculated. But Brando doesn&#39;t only present Vito Corleone as a cliché ruthless mafioso don, but also as a father that loves his family, and that the audience can admire and care for. Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire, John Gazale and Diane Keaton is also presented as capable and great characters! Everyone gets tons of character development, and their performances are spectacular!<br/><br/>Nino Rota&#39;s haunting score perfectly illustrates what kind of film we&#39;re dealing with here, and every time you hear it the score feels new and epic! This has got to be one of the most memorable film scores of all time! The cinematography is beautiful, the sound is fantastic and overall The Godfather is a truly beautiful film to admire! <br/><br/>Puzo and Coppola&#39;s screenplay is brilliant and filled with memorable lines: &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot;, &quot;Leave the gun, take the cannoli&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s not personal Sonny, it&#39;s strictly business&quot;. Francis Ford Coppola truly captures the feeling of a spaghetti gangster movie, and his direction is brilliant, tireless and visible in every scene! Twentieth Century Fox wanted to replace him several times during production, but thankfully they didn&#39;t! He was robbed an Oscar!<br/><br/>The Godfather is a movie that will never grow old, and we will be able to watch if for many years to come! It always feels fresh and exiting every time you watch it! From the first monologue by Bonasera, to the last shot of Michael Corleone as the new don, this movie leaves you shattered by the perfection. Saying The Godfather is a perfect movie, is like saying Chuck Norris is badass. See my point? A must-watch for everyone! <br/><br/>10/10"
2284,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One of my favorite movies of all time, from the plot to the characters being played and being Italian it&#39;s one of those movies I can watch over and over again. Its a true masterpiece of film, its a movie that you can watch a dozen times and never get board of. A timeless masterpiece, initially I was like The Godfather okay this movie sounds good, once I started watching it and getting the knowledge of the movie it was like wow this has to be no.1 movie in the world it was that good. Again one of my favorite all time movies to ever watch.<br/><br/>The cast in this movie was legendary, this movie has inspired many around the world. One of the best ever.<br/><br/>Now here is the thing watching all 3 of them in one day really gets you thinking about the movie in more detail on what it&#39;s about instead of just watching one you half to watch all 3 to really get a clear view of what&#39;s going to happen."
445,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption, based on the fantastic Stephen King novel, is a moving story about Andy Dufresne, an innocent man charged with the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to 40 years in prison and fights hard to survive, but in prison he forms a rare and close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis &#39;Red&#39; Redding. The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red, played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Morgan&#39;s deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy. The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost 20 years, he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there, Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving 40 years in prison he is reunited with Andy, it was a great ending to a beautiful movie."

3032,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Check out a copy of Mario Puzo&#39;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; from the library, or just buy the book (because you will want to anyway).  Lots of people have commented on things they liked or didn&#39;t like in the script, not realizing that they are taken straight from Puzo&#39;s masterpiece.  As (almost) always, the book is better than the movie.  Please do yourself a favor and pick up a copy somewhere, and if you aren&#39;t &quot;hooked&quot; by the second or third page I would be amazed.<br/><br/>One advantage of the book is it goes into much richer and more vivid detail than the film does (a lot of material from the book was used in the subsequent Godfather movies as well -- there&#39;s no way a single movie could ever capture that much detail).  It&#39;s a delightful and utterly satisfying tapestry.  If it sounds like I&#39;m reviewing the book more than the movie, it&#39;s probably because it&#39;s a long time since I&#39;ve seen the film -- but I re-read the book often because it&#39;s a work of literary genius and by far the finest work of fiction ever written on this subject.  If you&#39;re a fan of the film, please grab the book as soon as you can and prepare to be transported. You won&#39;t be able to put it down, and your respect and liking for the film can only grow afterward."

Sit down and enjoy one of the most best movies of all time.<br/><br/>The grow in Michael Corleone is remarkable during the development of the movie. You will never feel as much fear and respect as for Don Vito in any other gangster (if one dares to call this film a gangster film) movie.<br/><br/>And the opening scene of this movie is the material of legends. The death of Sony Corleone is the best scene in the entire movie. You could dissect this movie scene by scene and find pure cinematographic gold in each one of them.<br/><br/>Definitively a must see for everyone."
3771,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Having only been born 14 years after the release of The Godfather, I don&#39;t know if audiences at the time realised just how influential the film would become in later years. It has been homaged, parodied and copied so much - Don Corleone&#39;s husky voice and prominent chin especially - that it&#39;s a miracle it&#39;s managed to hold onto its status as one of the finest pictures Hollywood has ever produced. It&#39;s also rather astonishing that the film was ever made at all, given the troubled production amidst a meddling Paramount (who pretty much held a gun to director Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s head throughout). But watching it again, 41 years after it was made, it&#39;s just as beautiful and thrilling as it was when I first saw it.<br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the Sicilian head of the Corleone crime family. His eldest son Sonny (James Caan) is his short-tempered and hot-headed heir, the polar opposite to the youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who is college-educated and has just returned from serving in World War II. When the Don refuses an offer to invest in the booming drugs trade by drug baron Virgil &#39;The Turk&#39; Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) - who is backed by Corleone rivals the Tattaglia&#39;s - he is gunned down and almost killed. With his father in hospital and still in danger, Michael finds himself slowly being drawn into the family business he vowed to stay away from.<br/><br/>Head of Paramount at the time Bob Evans said he wanted to &quot;smell the spaghetti&quot; and hired the relatively inexperienced Coppola, who is of Sicilian heritage, to direct the film, in order to give the film authenticity. From the opening scene, it is evident that the gamble paid off. The wedding of the Don&#39;s daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), is a textbook guide on how to introduce characters to an audience. This long, gorgeous segment of the film establishes the Corleone&#39;s sense of family importance. They are all cold-blooded killers, perhaps, but they are loyal and have a code. It&#39;s also fascinating to see the hierarchy within organised crime, something that seems embedded into our conscience now after countless films involving &#39;made&#39; men and capo&#39;s.<br/><br/>But it&#39;s a combination of many elements that makes The Godfather so great. The patient, controlled approach, Coppola and novel author Mario Puzo&#39;s celebrated, Oscar-winning screenplay, Nino Rota&#39;s powerful score, the subtle dark comedy (&quot;leave the gun, take the cannoli&quot;) the magnificent set-pieces (Michael searching for the gun in the cafe restroom is still nerve-jangling) , and perhaps most of all, the acting talent on display. Brando, Pacino and Robert Duvall (as adopted son and consigliere Tom Hagen) can boast career-defining performances from the picture, and can celebrate film careers spanning decades and countless awards. There&#39;s little I can say about The Godfather that hasn&#39;t already been said, but this is one of the true undisputed classics of American cinema.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

It takes forever getting in, you spend like six and a half hours, I can&#39;t even get through it. I can&#39;t even finish the movie. I&#39;ve never even seen the ending. I have tried on three separate occasions to get through it and I get to the scene where all the guys are sitting around on the easy chairs. I have no idea what they&#39;re talking about. It&#39;s like they&#39;re speaking a different language. That&#39;s where I lose interest and I go away. I love The Money Pit with the guy from Big.

854,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent example of Hollywood craftsmanship. It has believable acting, excellent pacing, good cinematography and tells the story in a very effective manner. But it is film as a craft, not as an art.<br/><br/>To put this film in the same category as those of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Truffaut or Bergman is like comparing a piece of quality furniture to a Picasso.<br/><br/>I doubt even one in a hundred people, who hold this film in such high regard as to vote it #2, could actually name the director if you asked them in the street."
2457,tt0068646,The Godfather,"a very exciting and interesting movie,including a lot of good acting specially Al Pacino as Michael Corleone ,which make you think about many things. a movie consist of cruel,clever,killer and of course lonely characters. a movie about violence,about mafia and about the life of us ,the true life of us."
4414,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I watched this movie recently, and i am disappointed. I was expecting masterpiece, i was wrong. It is on the top, but i think it is highly overrated. The Godfather is definitely too long, some parts are absurd, like final scene when Mike tells his wife that he didn&#39;t kill his brother-in-law, and she believes him!!!!!! I was laughing and this is not a comedy. Music is bad, too many useless scenes. The Godfather is a good movie, but not brilliant, as many think. There are many better movies like: The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Lord of the Rings(1,2,3), Fight Club, etc. <br/><br/>When you like crime movies so better watch: Goodfellas, LA Confidential, Once Upon a Time in America.<br/><br/>Still i must admit Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Worth seeing 6/10, not a masterpiece."

What makes this movie the classic that it is is the &quot;life&quot; brought to the screen by this group of fine actors.  After seeing the film, I don&#39;t think that anyone could imagine Don Vito Corleone being played by anyone other than Marlon Brando, who is possibly the greatest actor in film history.  Same with Al Pacino in the role on Michael.  The cold hearted and hot headed bastard that is Michael could not have been portrayed better by any other actor.  James Caan as Sonny and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan....these men were born to play these parts.  Even Talia Shire, who I really don&#39;t care for much as an actress, delivers one hell of a stellar performance.  Diane Keaton, too.  It&#39;s performances like these that you only see once in a lifetime.  These actors and actresses create real lives for Mario Puzo&#39;s characters, each with such distinct personality that after watching the film, I refer to the characters by their first names, almost as if I know them.  The characters are portrayed so well that one could create a mock situation in ones head and accurately determine how a specific character would respond to it. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the story line here, but it&#39;s acting which makes this film a classic."
3567,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is considered my favorite movie and to many others, no wonder why The Godfather was considered to be the Perfect movie, cause of Frances Ford Coppola&#39;s Unquestionable direction and the film&#39;s story of the family business and a human story as well! This is the holy grail of gangster films that is to me and everyone, a real unforgettable classic! Excellent movie, quality acting, screenplay,depth of characters, locations! Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola&#39;s masterpiece. Mr.Cappola&#39;s refusal make another film only reflects great decision making in the industry. Many film makers in the future should emulate the overall quality shown in &quot;The Godfather&quot;."
2711,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I did get a little bored here and there. But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever, and I admire the acting. It&#39;s so wonderful and you see so many familular faces that you see today. I will never forget &quot;The Godfather&quot;.<br/><br/>9/10"
3655,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Up until I saw the Godfather, I did not truly understand what was a good movie. This is the best movie of all time. After initially watching the movie, I sat down and watched it again and appreciated the film even more. This movie is filled with classic scenes and classic lines. Marlon Brando is outstanding as Don Vito Corleone and equally good is Al Pacino. The scene in which Michael kills the policemen and the drug-lord is one of my favorites. The sound of a train builds and you can feel the intense passion of Michael Corleone. The transformation of Michael Corleone into a Don at the end of the movie is moving and underlies the central theme of family in the movie. Furthermore, the art direction is unbelievable with the footage in Italy and the wedding scene, both of which shaped film direction for latter generations of film makers. This movie is truly a gem and the best film of all time. Two thumbs way up!!"
133,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it&#39;s quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King&#39;s short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there&#39;s really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It&#39;s about hope... and the director won&#39;t let us forget it, so it&#39;s repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It&#39;s like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn&#39;t want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling &quot;for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!&quot; And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There&#39;s nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can&#39;t really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King&#39;s writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you&#39;re not a fan of any of these people, I doubt you&#39;d find this enjoyable. 5/10"
302,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"O.K. you&#39;ve seen the summary and you&#39;re screaming &quot;What kind of sour limey b@!*&amp;%$£ says that about one of the greatest films ever made?&quot; Well I&#39;ve got news for you, look again. The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie, i agree but is it all it&#39;s cracked up to be? - no. At first you think &quot;I feel great - what a feel-good movie!&quot; One can&#39;t help wondering that this film, on closer inspection, is actually unbelievably cheesy. Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didn&#39;t commit. It&#39;s stereotypical - and you guys who voted 10 bought it hook, line and sinker. &quot;But what about the great twist?&quot; O.k., the twist was good but come on...like i said before was it THAT great? Ask yourselves honestly, was that better than The Sixth Sense&#39;s or The Usual Suspects? Also, how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit? Watch Le Samurai, or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Far more superior."

4310,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Living up to the edge of this film is what each mob film stands for. This is the film that started the mob genre in my opinion. A classic story in its own mind, and a perfect hit to cinema. Based off the saga by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s first chapter of the epic legacy that lives on as The Godfather. The tale of a crime organization in the 1940s that go into a struggle for power when the leader is shot and hospitalized in a conspiracy, though continuously tended by his trusted sons, played by some of the now famous actors ever, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino. Terrificly follows the novel, with solid editing and setting, and outstanding performances by everybody. Fits elements that put you into the shoes of a true mobster, dealing with real mandatory things in a crime family, jobs, deaths, and deals. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone is a magnificent performance that really gets into the character of a true mob leader, making offers people can&#39;t refuse. Coppola&#39;s best work ever, and one of the greatest films ever made!"
3678,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Can someone please explain to me why this film is held in such high regard? I couldn&#39;t see anything particularly good about it to be honest and I&#39;m not one for finding fault normally but I would have to say that this is a badly directed, dragging film with unconvincing story and acting. Honestly, you&#39;d think someone else would have noticed before it got to the movie house, wouldn&#39;t you? If I could only use 10 words to describe this film they would be: Lame, Pedestrian, and Not as good as you think it is. So come on film buffs, let&#39;s admit the game is up, you&#39;ve been found out."
4406,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I think that Godfather 1 is the best movie ever made. Along side Enemy at the gates, The good The bad and The ugly, Popillon,The Message  is one of the outstanding movies, but I can say that godfather 1 is the best. It is my opinion that there are more than 10 sequences in this fabulous movie that we can rate them as the best sequences in history of cinema.<br/><br/>I think that story is fantastic; Marlon Brando is incredible, and all the actors and actresses are great. The ending is dramatic and music is also one of the best one. I often see the top sequences for 1 to 60 minutes. I really congratulate to Francis Ford Coppola for this excellent movie. YOU TAPE YOUR NAME IN HISTORY DEAR FRANCIS."
4282,tt0068646,The Godfather,"First of all, it&#39;s been a while since I decided to watch The Godfather, but somehow I&#39;ve never had enough will power to do so. I heard people saying it&#39;s the greatest movie of all time, but I was still being skeptical about this statement, as I couldn&#39;t imagine a movie with such long play time grabbing your attention all over it. When it started playing I could sense the outstanding feeling of the early 50&#39;s USA. It just felt natural to be part of this world, as we were born to it. The plot is not to be detailed, as it&#39;s one of the most famous movies, but I can assure everyone, this is the strongest part of the film. Of course there are some action scenes where bad people shoot with guns, there are some romantic scenes where beautiful woman make love with handsome man, but all of these give the essential of the Godfather. We learn the rules of this world, without directly being taught each of them. We become the part of the family, and we suffer or win, as the Corleones do. We start to worry about the characters, that feel alive and feel realistic. Our first, probably negative impression are getting overwrite by the deeper, and more considered emotions, which are more likely to be positive. We understand that some things have to be done, no matter what the morals say. Yes, we can live the life of the Corleones, and that&#39;s a thing not every movie can provide. The Godfather is not the best movie of all time, not for me at least. But it surely worth watching, not just because it&#39;s a legend, but for why it has become a legend."
3066,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The costumes and scenario and offcourse the actors are really good. The sound of the film are great, Al pacino and Marlo Brando excellent acting andthe oter thing i like are the cars really beatiful."
4749,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;I&#39;m selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can&#39;t handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don&#39;t deserve me at my best.&quot;"
3016,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie if so we can call it, because is more than a movie, it&#39;s the greatest union of artist, starting with the director finishing with the composer, stepping between the actors. Even if it&#39;s not a movie made by a &quot;true&quot; Sicilian, it smells like Sicily. Coppola presents to non-Sicilian spectator the gloomy charm of &quot;my&quot; arid land. It&#39;s not only a mob-movie but also a film where all the elements are united among them: love, hatred, violence, friendship, betrayals, beauty. From the first scene with a great Salvatore Corsitto as Amerigo Bonasera, to the last scene the film keeps even the reclutantest spectator in a vice of emotions. The evocative images of Sicily and don Corleone&#39;s speeches (and not only...) have made of this movie maybe the most important work in the cinematographic sphere of all times,an icon. In conclusion of this my short review I can say only one thing: I BELIEVE IN AMERICA"

5452,tt0068646,The Godfather,"A painted fruit bowl will not make you cry. It won&#39;t make you terrified. It&#39;s not romantic either and it won&#39;t change your mind on what you already thought about fruits. Yet it can still be a masterfully painted fruit bowl where al the fruits are beautifully portrayed by the artist the way they are. The Godfather is such a movie.<br/><br/>Just like most fruit bowl paintings, you wouldn&#39;t know if you had to root for the apple or the grapes. And during the entire movie you already know the fruits only have 2 possible outcomes: getting eaten or getting rot. I could go on with my analogy but I think you get the point. (edit: I will go on anyway)<br/><br/>Will you like this film?
Well, some people will stand in front of a perfectly painted fruit bowl for 5 minutes and become utterly bored because of the subject. Others can stand there for days being amazed by the details on the apple, and discovers new perfections every time they are watching the painting.<br/><br/>There is no good or wrong here. Everyone has their personal taste. After watching The Godfather you know what kind of person you are. I absolutely do recommend you watch it for yourself. At the end fruit bowl paintings (or other versions of still lives) have become very iconic and appreciated. Hopefully i made you hungry to see this masterfully crafted icon of a movie called The Godfather."

2591,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is &quot;The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces&quot; when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.<br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the &quot;Corleone Family Mafia&quot;. Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito&#39;s bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It&#39;s so dark at some points that Brando&#39;s eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino&#39;s acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."
151,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"It&#39;s not a complex tale, but it is a tale done well that is inspirational in spite of the bleak environment.<br/><br/>I am continually fascinated by the complexity of Andy Dufresne. (Presumably) the only innocent man in Shawshank, it is nevertheless Andy who seems to best incapsulate the guilt of his actions. Did he kill his wife? No. But I always feel as though he blames himself for her cheating, blames himself for wanting to kill her, and seems to accept his fate more than most men might.<br/><br/>The friendship of Red and Andy is regularly regarded as one of the high points of this film, and it has always resonated with me. The innocent man (Andy) breaks all sorts of laws and plans an elaborate prison break. The guilty man (Red) pays for his crimes and is eventually released on good behavior. Both end up together on a beach in Mexico, to live out the rest of their lives in solitude, apart from society. That&#39;s always felt like the tragedy of Shawshank; criminal or not, everyone ends up the same broken man by the end.<br/><br/>The brief moments of freedom in this film shine like nothing else, for me. The beer break on the roof, the opera played over the PA, and finally the broken boat on the shores of the Pacific: each of these moments is engineered by Andy to get a taste, a glimpse of freedom. Things that he had taken for granted before Shawshank. That scene where the men drink the beer on the roof looks like the tastiest beer I could ever imagine, almost completely because of the dark tone of the film up until that point."

4300,tt0068646,The Godfather,"*****Spoilers Ahead***** &#39;The Godfather&#39; is a film that everyone knows about. It is the type of film that is so heavily ingrained within popular culture that every reference, parody, and outright copy is almost a culture unto itself. It is because of this that even if you have not had the pleasure of viewing Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s master work, you feel like you have. It is also because of this that a surprising number of people never get around to watching &#39;The Godfather&#39;. Afraid that they&#39;ll be entering a world of endless Mafia cliché and hackneyed dialogue, they steer clear of this gem of a film. A few days ago I was one of those people. Now - after picking up the box set for the meagre sum of fifteen pounds – I would count myself as one of the lucky portion of the population who has seen &#39;The Godfather&#39;.<br/><br/>For the uninformed the story of &#39;The Godfather&#39; is, on the surface, simple gangster fare. The film, set in the late forties, follows the trials and tribulations of the Corleone family – one of five mobs in New York – as they try to stay on top as the supreme power in the city. What actually comes is a complex tale which carries weighty themes such as the corruption of innocence, the loss of the American Dream, and the cyclical nature of a life in crime.<br/><br/>What struck me most about &#39;The Godfather&#39; was how sedate it was when compared with other pieces of cinema. A few nights before, I watched &#39;City of God&#39;, a film about child gangs in Rio De Janeiro. This film, although slick and well presented, ultimately didn&#39;t leave much room for reflection on what is a very heavy and ugly subject; It left me feeling cold. It tried to point out the horrific state that Brazilian slums were in, but was so desperate to look good that it almost missed its own point.<br/><br/>In stark contrast, &#39;The Godfather&#39; is nothing if not thoughtful. Every scene, although well directed, never tries to point out its own style in any kind of pronounced manner. This could be more to do with older directorial styles but it still stands out. In a time when films revolving around gangs are nothing but frenetic gun-toting festivals of violence, blood, guts, and vague subtexts, it is refreshing to see a film that presents its concepts and central themes in a way that allows the viewer to actually digest them. Any on-screen violence that does happen is necessary to move the plot forward and is exactly the way cinema violence should be – blunt, seemingly real, and uncomfortable to watch. It is as though the film has sat you down and said &quot;This violence here. You see that? Pretty nasty huh? You don&#39;t want to see it again, do you? No? Good. Now listen to what we have to say about the flawed nature of the American Dream.&quot; It actively makes you despise the brutality of a life in crime by making it feel relentlessly vicious.<br/><br/>This is illustrated in one scene involving family member Michael in a café. His task is to kill the two men opposite him. A train can be heard outside. As the noise of the train becomes louder and louder we see Michaels hand in his pocket, desperately toying with the gun. His face is tense and sweating profusely. The train grows louder and louder still, its cacophony overwhelming to the viewer, and you can feel the tension that must be welling up inside of Michael until he eventually pulls the trigger in what turns out to be a fairly botched assassination. Not only does this type of abhorrence to violence help make you acutely aware of the horrid nature of the &#39;family business&#39; but it also drives Michaels story along as he becomes more desensitised to this type of brutality whilst he climbs the ranks of his business before becoming the patriarchal figure that he had, at one time, no desire to be. By the end of the film, a killing is nothing in the eyes of what was once an honest American citizen with unfortunate family ties.<br/><br/>I mentioned in the opening paragraph that &#39;The Godfather&#39; is a film that is referenced so much that it is easy to pass it by whilst still somehow feeling like you&#39;ve watched it. Although you still kind of get that feeling on viewing, it feels more like a welcoming friend than a cliché ridden hammy mess. From the iconic music to the infamous line &quot;We&#39;ll make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot;, from the horses head in the bed to badda bing badda boom. No matter how many parodies of &#39;The Godfather&#39; you may have seen - and there are a lot of them – these moments that we all know of never detract from a full viewing. When everything is in context and being performed by an astonishingly good cast you forget about every other crappy gangster film you&#39;ve ever seen and just get sucked straight in.<br/><br/>In conclusion, watch this film. No matter who you are or what films you usually like, watch this one. Even if you don&#39;t enjoy it, it&#39;s worth just experiencing such a beautifully made film. If you can pick up the Coppola restoration then it&#39;s even better to look at. Do it now. Watch it!"
2917,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Godfather is one of the rare films that I watch over and over and every time I enjoy it the same as first time. It is true masterpiece in many ways from directing and acting to mesmerizing quotes and music. To me it has layers that every time I watch I find something new in it. Its interesting approach to the world of women that overshadowed under Muscular games of men mirrored the social issues of 50s in its hidden layers. The color theme in dark brown scenes reminded the Gothic era and architecture works perfectly. Men in dark rooms and covered windows taking care of their mostly illegal business. Soundtrack inspired by Italian old song comes on the task of dramatizing events moved some scenes in some scenes of violence with the hypocritical guise of characters, that lead us to a deep inferiority."
5307,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&#39;The Godfather&#39; - who not seen it yet, as not been live, cult and excellent movie, one of (not just) my favorite. I love godfather, i can see it, maybe...maybe, 10x, maybe 15x and every time I look like child which get new toy. Music is one of the best ever (not just OST), camera is also brilliant, ALL actors are daring and stunning as director of this spectacle. And Fredo Corleone is adorable. Everyone, must see it, and when I say everyone, I mean everyone. 100%, 10/10, 5/5, 4/4 or how you want. Just...just WOW. Thank you to all the crew of the film, you are all worthy of an Oscar."
2861,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a passion and love for film. In few movies can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all &quot;gangster movies&quot; have been judged by the standards of this one.<br/><br/>If The Godfather was only about gun Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.<br/><br/>Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather&#39;s success. Every major character,and more than a few minor ones is molded into a distinct, complex individual.<br/><br/>The film Begins in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.<br/><br/>The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito&#39;s youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their &quot;adopted&quot; brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don&#39;s right-hand man.<br/><br/>With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.<br/><br/>Don Vito&#39;s refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.<br/><br/>The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it&#39;s therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from &quot;innocent&quot; bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.<br/><br/>Next to Humphrey Bogart&#39;s Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando&#39;s Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot; has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.<br/><br/>Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (&quot;A man who doesn&#39;t spend time with his family can never be a real man&quot;) and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the &quot;throne&quot;, is one of The Godfather&#39;s most revealing moments (about both father and son).<br/><br/>The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it&#39;s surprising that Duvall wasn&#39;t passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn&#39;t flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan&#39;s Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can&#39;t be overlooked.<br/><br/>Family responsibility. A father&#39;s legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.<br/><br/>Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York&#39;s Italian crime families. The word &quot;Mafia&quot; conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience."
1443,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"A classic that cuts over genre lines and has a significant effect on viewers, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is ageless. This movie, which is based on Stephen King&#39;s novella, is a celebration of the human spirit, resiliency, and optimism.<br/><br/>The tale, which is set inside Shawshank State Penitentiary, centers on Tim Robbins&#39;s portrayal of Andy Dufresne as he struggles through the harsh reality of prison life. Andy finds comfort in his connection with fellow prisoner Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding, who is portrayed by Morgan Freeman with nuance and charm, after being falsely accused of a crime he did not commit. The film&#39;s central theme is their friendship, which acts as a ray of hope among the gloom of incarceration."
1162,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t mean to offend people who like this film but what on earth is all the fuss about over this film it is nothing compared to The Godfather and yet people vote it as second to the number 1!? The Shawshank Redemption has a relatively simple plot ,dull camera work the script is full of soppy language (thanks to the overrated Steven King)that just isn&#39;t particularly clever in any way.The atmosphere of &#39;prison&#39; is totally unrealistic all the characters are wimps.The only good element is Morgan Freeman because he&#39;s a good actor.There aren&#39;t any clever twists-for instance the &#39;mystery&#39; of what is in the box at the end of the film is really unoriginal. Please feel free to argue with me over this but come on people step back and look at the film what is it made up of? Then look at The Godfather look at what that is made up of - Brill cast, excellent plot, damn good script, good directing and camera work everything is perfect then look back at the Shawshank redemption its just at a completely different level. Its quite ridiculous really."
1324,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The ingenuity of a prisoner who displayed this film is really wrapped well. Behind his cold gaze, there was a surprising action."
3099,tt0068646,The Godfather,What Can I Say ??? Is There a Word Who Realy Can Explain About This Greatest Masterpiece
2085,tt0068646,The Godfather,"So The Godfather (1972)? Absolute chef&#39;s kiss. It&#39;s one of those rare movies that lives up to the hype, and somehow feels even better when you watch it again. Like a good espresso - it&#39;s rich, it&#39;s dark, and it doesn&#39;t mess around. Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone? He doesn&#39;t moves, doesn&#39;t talks above a whisper, and still somehow commands the entire room. It&#39;s like watching a lion yawn - you&#39;re just waiting for someone to lose a limb. And Al Pacino? Ugh. Baby-faced war hero to cold-blooded boss? The transformation is so slow and subtle, you don&#39;t even realize you&#39;ve crossed the line with him until BAM - you&#39;re in the dark with him and you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh... we&#39;re here now.&quot; It&#39;s not fast-paced, and it makes you wait, but every second is worth it. The tension builds like pressure in a moka pot - you can feel something brewing, and when it explodes, it explodes. The whole vibe is steeped in old-school drama. Everything&#39;s lit, full of shadows and brown tones like an antique coffee shop where the espresso tastes like it&#39;s seen some things. And the quotes? Iconic. &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse.&quot; &quot;Leave the gun, take the cannoli.&quot; It&#39;s cool. The ending? When the door closes on Kay? That final shot is haunting. Like... you knew it was coming, but it still hits you in the chest. That&#39;s how you do a character arc. If you haven&#39;t watched it yet - or haven&#39;t in a bit -this is your sign. Make a cup of coffee, turn off the lights, and let yourself get sucked into that world. It&#39;s the kind of movie that sticks to your ribs. Ten outta ten cannoli. No notes."
4130,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I watched this movie two times. First time I watched without subtitles, so didn&#39;t understand much but recently I have started to read the real Godfather novel (which is pretty much engaging) and also watched the movie last night (with subtitles this time). There is not much twist and turn in the movie, so this movie is straight and simple and also slow paced. But the cinematography and scenes you see in this movie, is top notch. You can also see the the Italian culture in it&#39;s true nature. You can also understand how the mafia families actually work. But this is not a movie which can leave a longer impact in your mind. You will forget the movie in few days."
556,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"An outstanding movie about perseverance, brains and irony. It&#39;s certainly the greatest prison movie ever made. But there&#39;s a lot more involved than your average prison flick has to offer. Try character and character development for starters.<br/><br/>The best thing King has written, I love &quot;Salems Lot&quot; but how can you top this one."
2428,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Honesly couldn&#39;t see what all the fuss is about. I felt this film lacked the very basics which make a good film. Good actors boring story and even worse directing!!! Perhaps this is because i only watched the movie for the first time recently, and therefore am comparing it to the standard set by todays writers, producers, and directors? I don&#39;t doubt it was a masterful production in its day but honestly the bar set by current movie makers really sees the &#39;God father&#39; sorely outclassed. It is my conjecture that those who voted 9 and 10 out of ten did so because they remember how good it was in its hay-day instead of comparing it to all movies past and present before rating it."

4781,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather series is one of the most popular in the entire movie industry, and starting with the first one released in 1972 following the traditional Mafia path and some familiar mafia family references, this movie takes you on a journey worthwhile for any Mafia fan. As Vito Corleone takes the control of the Corleone family, you get to see incredible hard-taken decisions that will move the plot radically from a moment to another, leaving you constantly asking what&#39;s about to happen next and bringing an incredible sense of excitement to the entire experience. This movie is without doubt one of the best movies ever made, not only for the hardcore Mafia fans, but for anyone who appreciates a good plot and even more, a good universe created around an iconic idea."
2761,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Alright so here&#39;s how I feel. I got the same exact feeling when I watched pulp fiction, I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s this masterpiece and that it&#39;s one of the best movies ever and then I watch it and... it&#39;s not. To be honest it&#39;s kinda boring maybe it&#39;s just me idk. Here&#39;s the thing there&#39;s definitely something here like at one point or another I&#39;m gonna rewatch this movie and maybe then it&#39;ll be good. I can tell that there&#39;s definitely a good story here but this first go around I just can&#39;t see it and here the other issue it&#39;s so long like personally I don&#39;t think movies need to be this long the only movie that should be this long are movies similar to end game like thrilling conclusion movies with a bunch of loose ends to tie up. Something like this it just drags and gets confusing so quickly I constantly had to pause and go back and ask questions like something about this movie doesn&#39;t click with me and I really want it to just don&#39;t get it and I wish I did and maybe one day I will but today is not that day."
5248,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I should probably go to bed. It&#39;s late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.<br/><br/>This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it&#39;s so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions."
1206,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,It is really a nice movie I have seen. In beginning it seems some boring but after one hour it change the atmosphere. It is well planned and seen are thriller. I never seen such a beautiful movie. The role which actor has played is memorable and very energetic. I recommend to see it all the movie likers. Must watch movie.
3042,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Definitely not the greatest movie of all time, but the greatest crime movie it could be. Not only because of the very good and epic story (Mario Puzo), but also because of the aesthetics and fabulous cinematography by Gordon Willis (Annie Hall, Klute). Not to mention the absolutely fantastic cast. It&#39;s is impressive that Marlon Brando played the completely different part he did the same year in Bertolucci&#39;s &#39;Ultimo tango a Parigi&#39;. I think it is a pity Sterling Hayden (The Killing, Dr. Strangelove, Asphalt Jungle) had such small part in this nine-hour trilogy.<br/><br/>One of the most distinctive elements of this great crime movie is the music, which was already recognizable in &#39;Rocco e i suoi fratelli&#39; (Visconti, 1960) and was more or less recycled for this film by Nino Rota (Amarcord, Obsession, Boccaccio &#39;70).<br/><br/>10 points out of 10 :-)"
852,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Many, many people jock this movie, calling it an intelligent, philosophical and moving epic, but It&#39;s really not all that. It is a good movie, but it is not great or thought provoking at all. That year, 1994, was a great year for movies considering Pulp Fiction, Ed Wood and Quiz Show among others, yet people think Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption are great&#39; movies? Gag me.<br/><br/>Here&#39;s some of the problems (Don&#39;t read this if you haven&#39;t seen the movie)<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman&#39;s character - Don&#39;t get me wrong Freeman is a great actor (even if he always plays the same part) but seriously, did you ever watch MTV&#39;s Scared Straight&#39; or listened to Chris Rock&#39;s stand-up? Now tell me what kind of 18-year-old murderer goes to prison and kicks around using words that would make Edgar Allen Poe go get his copy of Webster&#39;s? Freeman&#39;s character&#39;s narration also served as a purpose to constantly bludgeon the viewer with 2nd rate philosophy people who&#39;ve never been to prison come up with. By the end I was literally exhausted from the constant stream of corny insight I&#39;ve already heard. Tell the truth now... If you saw a murderer on the evening news you&#39;d probably want him dead or at least in prison for life, yet here you&#39;re supposed to rejoice in his parole as a result of a tired, bitch-em-out-I-don&#39;t-care speech that only seems to come up in movies. Another detraction to the narration is Morgan Freeman dropping the F, it never sounds right.<br/><br/>The Warden - How many absolutely despicable characters has that guy played? Has anyone that evil ever run a prison? That is classic jail movie material. Obviously the filmmakers realize people will be upset about glorifying criminals so the answer is to make the authority pure evil. How irritating If you want to convey criminals, just show them having fun and being real people; don&#39;t try to cover it up with evil police, try Bonnie and Clyde or Pulp Fiction, much more interesting.<br/><br/>Brooks  Some serious button pushing here. Brooks is a typical, lame attempt to draw out some sentiment. The bird thing is a rip off of Escape from Alcatraz and like Freeman&#39;s character he&#39;s a great guy who happened to commit an offense so despicable he&#39;s in one of the most secure prisons in the country, but we can forget about that, right? The `Brooks was here&#39; hanging himself because he can&#39;t keep up is another Hollywood favorite. Who hangs themselves? My gosh, at Nuremberg guys took poison to avoid being hanged because of the shame and disrespect. Yet, Brooks hung himself when at his age he could have waited a week and let nature take its course. Or better yet if Brooks got an old-fashioned whore and binged himself to death on alcohol and mind-altering drugs. Almost sounds like fun, who would prefer hanging? You know who, a character in a movie. That pretty much sums up the Shawshank Redemption, for what its aiming for it misfires because there is nothing genuine or authentic about it."
1157,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"There&#39;s a reason why The Shawshank Redemption is top of so many film lists. It is a brilliant adaptation of the book by Stephen King. It captures the eloquence of his words and brings the characters to life. You care about the people in this film, and you&#39;re hurt when they are hurting. You want them to succeed, and the pay-off more than justifies the journey. If you haven&#39;t seen this film, why not watch it next?"
2050,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The unique. The only one . The greatest Godfather.<br/><br/>Any man has a lot of lessons to learn from this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, VALUE THE FAMILY. &quot;A man who doesn&#39;t spend time with his family can never be a real man&quot;- says Vito. You should protect your family it&#39;s your responsibility and your duty. You must spend time with your family if you want to be a real man. This is one of the lessons Michael learned from his father and used it so much.<br/><br/>Secondly, PLAN EVERYTHING. &quot;Woman and children can afford to be careless, men can not.&quot; You are the king of your life but to prove it you must be ready to any situation in your life and make sacrifices for your family. You should be thinking about and finding solutions to the problems not the women.<br/><br/>I would write more than 50 lessons that I&#39;ve learned but there is an offer I can&#39;t refuse- I must sleep)<br/><br/>Strongly recommend everyone ( especially men) to watch this movie. It will never be aged."
2043,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One of the most iconic films in history, it is top 2 on IMDb and many people consider it to be the best film ever made.<br/><br/>It is without a doubt a great Drama and Crime film. The way the film shows the mafia from within the mafia is brilliant, instead of the protagonists being the good guys, and it works very well, because of the script and direction.<br/><br/>The film shows Don Corleone, a great Italian mobster in New York, and shows very well how, in addition to ordering crimes and being influential in politics and in several other sectors, he is respected, they call him the godfather because of the respect they have for him, in addition to the film showing a lot of how he takes care of and worries a lot about his family. He is undoubtedly one of the most iconic characters of all. The film shows that he was attacked and while he was injured his son, Michael Corleone, took over the family business. This was the son who went to college, served in the war and didn&#39;t care about the family business, and yet he was the one who took his father&#39;s place. He is a character who is always trying to hide his feelings, but is very impulsive at times. The film also focuses a lot on other members of the Corleone family, such as Dom&#39;s daughter and other children, and also on the gang war taking place.<br/><br/>The film is almost three hours long, and although it is very focused on dialogue, it is not a boring film. In some parts of the gang war I felt a little confused watching it, I think it is because the film shows and mentions so many characters, but the film&#39;s script is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s direction is incredible, combined with the wonderful performances of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in particular, some scenes are incredibly tense, for example the scene where Michael is going to kill the police officers and the noise of a train appears, it&#39;s incredible how it shows the confusion in his mind with this and with Al Pacino&#39;s performance without saying a single word, among other incredible and iconic scenes in the film. The film&#39;s photography is beautiful, the soundtrack is iconic, the setting and costumes are also incredible.<br/><br/>Overall, I really think the film is a masterpiece as they say, but personally I found the film a little confusing."
5082,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Today a very well known movie and for me the best ever. The story is based on the novel -The Godfather- from which the movie obviously got its name and it follows the most part of the story in the novel. The cast is also excellent the stars who play each character fit their role in the movie perfectly. Some parts of the story may become confusing to some audience if they don&#39;t pay much attention to the movie, i found the movie more interesting when i watched it the 3rd time because I had missed some tiny details which make this movie so good. The story won&#39;t become boring, it keeps you watching the movie all the time because you really want to know what will happen next which is quite rare in many movies. The effects are also done well for the 70&#39;s period, they look very realistic. The movie really gives you a good description of that dark period in history in a non boring way.Those who enjoy watching drama will love this movie."
3299,tt0068646,The Godfather,I cant imagine this masterpiece made in 1972 its sooo good from the actors to the soundtrack to the twists to the mafia feel to the ending every thing was made by genius even it was old movie if you watched it you will fell its like in 2010 it was ahead of its time
567,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I always really enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption and my appreciation remains consistent with repeated viewings. With a 9.3 IMDB rating decades after it&#39;s release shows that this is a movie that speaks to people and I have not met anyone who doesn&#39;t like this movie. Among Steven King adaptations this is probably the best, I like Stanley Kubrick&#39;s The Shining, just as much for different reasons. But don&#39;t tell Steven King that, lol. The Shawshank Redemption is much more than a prison movie, it&#39;s an absolutely engrossing movie that has audiences glued to the screen from start to finish. Director Frank Darabond did a fantastic job putting this together with top notch cinematography, direction and a great attention to detail. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give unforgettable performances. The Shawshank Redemption is flawless filmmaking and storytelling that has few films that are it&#39;s equal. All and all, The Shawshank Redemption is perfect in my book and is recommended to anybody who wants to see a great movie."
1676,tt0068646,The Godfather,"What&#39;s to say about this movie that hasn&#39;t been said already. Pure cinema magic. The casting is superb, the character development is superb, the acting is first class, coupled with the legendary soundtrack a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>From the script to the whole dialogue and interactions between the characters the attention to detail is stunning and I wish more modern movie makers would take the time to build and develop the characters like this movie does.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, when Bonasera is looking for revenge for the beating of his daughter, to the closing scene when Kay sees Michael crowned as the Don and Neri closes the door, the movie just flows seamlessly from act to act. Coupled with the legendary soundtrack<br/><br/>The scene where Sonny, Michael, Tessio, Hagen and Clemenza are discussing hitting Solozzo is pure gold. As they all sit around nonchalantly discussing murder, before Michael pipes up and tells them how if they arrange a meeting he will kill them both is so just so well acted, that you actually believe these guys are gangsters.<br/><br/>A real example of great story telling transferred to film."
3921,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This Movie is Awesome. Every character has done Justice. Story line is perfect. I have never seen any Movie better than this one. This is like a BluePrint for the Movies of this Genre. Francis Ford Coppola,Al Pacino,Marlon Brando all of them created History. It keeps viewers guessing what will happen next,every second of this 175 minutes movie has kept audience excited. This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance. The plot excellent for it to get ten out of ten, I give this movie ten out of ten, as I stated earlier it&#39;s far from predictable.It is a real piece of gold which will shine for the life time.A must watch movie for the movie lovers."
2654,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo&#39;s pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.<br/><br/>When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.<br/><br/>Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.<br/><br/>The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter&#39;s wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito&#39;s help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.<br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito&#39;s reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.<br/><br/>The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father&#39;s death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.<br/><br/>In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.<br/><br/>The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.<br/><br/>So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.<br/><br/>Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone&#39;s rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies."
3364,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is as beautifully directed, photographed, designed, edited, scored, and performed as any American film -- it is a masterpiece in the broadest sense; a colossal accomplishment for Francis Ford Coppola in the decade he virtually owned as a popular and artistic filmmaker.  Indelible scenes need only a word or two to ignite the memory: the baptism, the horse head, Sonny&#39;s fate, the restaurant murder, and the list goes on.  Brando and Pacino are fantastic, but I love to praise the work of James Caan and Robert Duvall.  Their roles might be smaller, but I couldn&#39;t imagine the film without them.  The fury with which Sonny unleashes the brutal beatdown of Carlo is palpable, and I adore the brilliant impartiality and distance kept by the camera (it seems to hover in medium shot just far enough to keep the children playing in the opened hydrant in frame during the course of the pounding) as well as the other onlookers who know better than to get in the middle."
1699,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It&#39;s a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie."
5457,tt0068646,The Godfather,"With performances, style and substance to savour, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless."
1634,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Coppola&#39;s near perfect masterpiece. A first class cast including, James Caan, Al Pacino and heavy weight Marlon Brando to name a few. There is not much I can add that hasn&#39;t already been written, it frankly is the quintessential family, Mafia gangster film.<br/><br/>The 1950&#39;s nostalgic feel is captured, distinguished cinematography by Gordon Willis and the script honed. The costumes, locations and sets add to the overall authentic experience. Brando&#39;s aged make-up is incredible, particularly for 1972 and apart from some insignificant choppy editing and stock footage the film is near enough picture perfect.<br/><br/>Timeless, compulsive viewing, there is a reason why The Godfather is on a pedestal as one of the greatest movies or of all time There is no offer to refuse, it&#39;s a must see."

223,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont&#39;s screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.<br/><br/>Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.<br/><br/>The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.<br/><br/>It didn&#39;t do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critic&#39;s high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King&#39;s books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of King&#39;s books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.<br/><br/>Here is a DVD every home should have.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
2338,tt0068646,The Godfather,"A note about the poor reviews-
Reading through the lower one and two star ratings I was shocked to see how many people are incapable of understanding the true masterpiece of a film that this is. The fact that people think this is unrealistic shows that they know nothing of this time period of mafia. They think of Al Capone and the violence that is related to him, and assume this is the only type of person in the mafia. You need to understand that the mafia wasn&#39;t just guns, money, and murder. It was a business, yes illegal, but a business. It had class. People who say this movie didn&#39;t have plot shock me. It tells me they were either not paying attention or just too simple minded to understand it.<br/><br/>On a note about the movie-
It was an excellent portrayal of the mafia during this time. Everything about this movie was perfect. The acting was so believable it&#39;s hard to see these actors in other films. The culture of Italian American and Italian is touching and realistic. The show of family, emotions, and the complexities of the underworld are superior to any other film, specifically other mafia movies. I enjoy Goodfellas and Scarface but they just don&#39;t compare. We must remember that they are set in different time periods so they are all realistic but very different, for this reason you cannot say the Godfather isn&#39;t realistic because it isn&#39;t similar to Goodfellas. I prefer the class and composure of the older setting in Godfather. Truly an amazing film. Undoubtedly the best."

1005,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"As someone who loves films, The Shawshank Redemption was a necessary watch. After finally being able to see it, I can say I was not disappointed at the slightest.<br/><br/>The Shawshank Redemption follows Andy Dufresne, a young banker sentenced to two life terms in prison. There he befriends and bonds with Red, a long-term inmate.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Frank Darabont, this tale of hope, friendship and redemption is widely regarded as one of the best films of all time. Solidified as IMDb&#39;s highest rated film, The Shawshank Redemption has been recognised as a culturally important universal crowdpleaser. I really enjoyed The Green Mile, another Darabont feature, but I think this film is better. The script by Darabont is absolutely fantastic. The film is filled with so many memorable scenes with well-written dialogues that will move and uplift you. The characters are so beautifully presented and developed. Despite being prisoners, Darabont manages to humanises these people and make us truly care about them. Our two main characters, Andy and Red, are played marvellously by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially outstanding due to the way he interacts with others around him and how he delivers dialogues. The scenes where he&#39;s asked if he feels rehabilitated are some of my favourite in the film as Freeman&#39;s acting in conjunction with Darabont&#39;s writing make the scene as powerful as it can be. I loved the development of Andy and Red&#39;s friendship. It was executed very well and I felt like I had a personal connection with them throughout the time they were in prison.<br/><br/>Despite having such a simple premise, Frank Darabont is able to bring out such a powerful message about hope. The film doesn&#39;t lose sight of this theme and it&#39;s brilliantly woven throughout the story and makes a lasting impact as the film reaches its climax. He has a particular style of telling the stories he&#39;s making which manage to create a deep and emotional impact on the audience. There were points where I was reminded of The Green Mile. The film is gorgeously shot. The aerial shot of the towering Shawshank prison with Thomas Newman&#39;s amazing score playing in the background is one of the best. Newman&#39;s score landed an Oscar nomination which I found to be well deserved. His score is beautiful to listen to. It has such an uplifting tone to it that can easily generate an emotional response from the audience.<br/><br/>The Shawshank Redemption was an incredible experience. The performances by Robbins and Freeman are oustanding and Frank Darabont really showcased his capabilities here as a writer and director. He&#39;s made a beautiful and heartfelt film that leaves a long-lasting smile on your face."
662,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,This is certainly not a bad film but it is Also completely overated in my opinion. This story has been done a million times and How the wardens didn&#39;t notice he was chipping through the wall everyday to escape is beyond me. The acting throughout is very good but i am shocked to see this number 1 on the chart.
1476,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It&#39;s basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo&#39;s story; due to how popular the film is. Even, if you haven&#39;t saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo&#39;s 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando&#39;s work in this, a way too much. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don&#39;t believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated &amp; won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando&#39;s acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It&#39;s not personality, it&#39;s only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn&#39;t much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael&#39;s hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael&#39;s girlfriend, Kay Adams &amp; last, John Cazale as Michael&#39;s weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can&#39;t help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and &#39;the family life&#39;. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It&#39;s a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It&#39;s as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It&#39;s also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito&#39;s daughter&#39;s wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas &amp; Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel&#39;s subplots, such as Sonny&#39;s mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I&#39;m glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito&#39;s youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974&#39;s the Godfather: Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word &#39;mafia&#39; when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn&#39;t deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn&#39;t stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It&#39;s a classic."
2289,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather has set the boundaries off all crime drama films that have ever been shown to people around the world. No one, will ever go beyond this film, it is truly magnificent. The film shows how the Corleone crime family want revenge on the men that tried to destroy them and there old beloved Don. Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando can been seen as some greatest acting that has ever been placed inside Hollywood. The famous line &quot;I&#39;ll make him an offer he cant refuse&quot; will always be rembered. <br/><br/>Brando plays a character that is a family man, who wants to keep his family safe from the underwold. As well as to get out of the family business. He man who never wanted his sons to go join him, but yet he could do nothing about it. He is man of respect, a man who knows when the right time is, no matter what the situatuion is. He is the Godafther. When he was nealry killed by the drug baron called Sollozzo, he knew that his time as Don was up. He knew that there would be war, bloodshed,and that he could do nothung until he was ready again. His oldest son who was hot headed, angary, but a wonderful tactican like a general could never run this family. His second son Fredo was not man enough to to do his job. He youngest son though, the person who killed Sollozzo, was a calm, thoughtfull, ruthless man, and would be the person to take over the family business. Even to his displeasure, that he never wanted this to happen to his son at all, he knew it was the right thing to help bring back the weakened Corleone Crime Family, into where they belong. The king of the American Mafia Underworld, and the only way to do it is to destroy the five familes of New York."
180,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a well educated banker, is wrongfully convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison at Shawshank Penitentiary. This movie follows his life as it falls apart and he succumbs to living as an inmate surrounded by hardened criminals and a strict bible thumping warden with his henchmen prison guards.<br/><br/>Saw this movie years ago and was absolutely stunned. This film is a genuine masterpiece and probably the greatest movie ever made. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing and just steal the show as convicts turned best friends. The movie is perfectly paced with very real characters and emotions that are all captivating. The prison itself is very authentic and the set pieces are very realistic which captured the prison environment better than any other prison set film except for maybe Escape From Alcatraz. Even as a hard drama this movie is never slow or boring or dry it is simply just that good."
132,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This is a good movie, and surely is right up there among the finest prison/concentration camp depictions which almost ALWAYS have at least competent quality. In my mind I compare this genre to &quot;submarine&quot;-films: confined space, lots of guys under constant threat, therefore drama and tension easily created without much sweat (ha ha). But also with obvious problems in providing something new. The same situations and characters are presented just from here to eternity, and I rest my case with this movie in question as follows: despotic warden, sadistic guard/s, evil fellow inmates who want to kill/rape you but also few trusted friends (along with that one old timer and his inevitable sad ending) and finally escape by the main protagonist who of course has been convicted in the first place based on false accusations or at least something not-so-bad crime.<br/><br/>So what&#39;s so special here? 9.1/10, come on... Maybe the same tricks worked here as in that other Stephen King&#39;s hit-penitentiary-drama &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, i.e. manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard characters. Or maybe the majority of movie-goers consider what they&#39;re watching at face value and never mind that &quot;I&#39;ve seen this all before&quot;-feel. Or maybe they haven&#39;t or just have a lousy memory? Yes I admit, I&#39;m something of a cynic. But I also believe I&#39;m able to spot an truly honest effort when I see one. Probably that&#39;s the reason why I consider the grandpa of them all, Mervyn LeRoy&#39;s 1932 &quot;I&#39;m A Fugitive From A Chain Gang&quot; as the all-time best prison-flick. No film-snobbery here, as I hope you&#39;ll agree when you see this true classic."
2439,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This film captivates audiences by immersing them in an underworld that exists right under our noses. Coppola skillfully places us in the midst of a society created by and for criminals, where cold-blooded murderers and seemingly honorable men coexist. The film delves into the Corleone family, led by Don Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando. Don Vito, while occupying a unique position on the edge of this world, struggles to reconcile his moral principles with the reality of his surroundings. One particularly memorable scene takes place during his daughter&#39;s wedding, where his associate, Luca Brasi, rehearses a speech to be delivered to the Don. This scene showcases a humorous and endearing interaction between the two characters, evoking unexpected sympathy for these mobsters. It is worth noting that Lenny Montana, who played Luca Brasi, was an actual former mob hit-man, adding an extra layer of authenticity to his performance."

3827,tt0068646,The Godfather,"IT was good for its time yeah sure but do you really still think it deserves #1 of ALL TIME!!?? I just think there are better films out there ones with more action, suspense,special effects ( i know it was low budget),actors etc. There just seemed to be more dialogue than anything else in the film put together. If you showed this to the younger generation then they would simply not be impressed. There are bigger titles out now and why is everyone still voting this in? It would be much better to vote the lord of the rings trilogy in the top 3 or put the shaw shank redemption at #1 that would make more sense. I would personally put &quot;The Godfather&quot; at #5 seeing as it does have the best title for a film of all time."

3061,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In 1945 New York City, at his daughter Connie&#39;s wedding to Carlo, Vito Corleone listens to requests in his role as don of the Corleone crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito&#39;s godson, seeks Vito&#39;s help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.<br/><br/>Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen, then has Vito gunned down in the street. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo&#39;s deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi&#39;s bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca &quot;sleeps with the fishes&quot;. Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael&#39;s jaw is broken by NYPD Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo&#39;s unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by Clemenza, a Corleone capo, he kills both men.<br/><br/>Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons&#39; safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding submachine guns. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.<br/><br/>Devastated by Sonny&#39;s death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny&#39;s murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a &quot;wartime consigliere&quot;; Vito agrees Hagen should &quot;have no part in what will happen&quot; in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene&#39;s stake in the family&#39;s casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.<br/><br/>In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie&#39;s baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child&#39;s godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio&#39;s treachery leads to his execution. Michael extracts Carlo&#39;s confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny&#39;s murder for Barzini; Clemenza garrotes Carlo to death. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her."

1456,tt0068646,The Godfather,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I&#39;ve seen, so much so I couldn&#39;t think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn&#39;t see this film before now.<br/><br/>True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.<br/><br/>The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.<br/><br/>Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse&#39;s head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino&#39;s casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.<br/><br/>In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox"

amazing piece of art"
5375,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo and it&#39;s based on Puzo&#39;s best-selling novel of the same name. Why is this film regarded as a classic and of course among of the best films in history? It&#39;s an three hour ride of cinema of some of the finest written, finest acted, finest cinematography, finest editing, the remarkable musical score by Nino Rota and of course the brilliance that is Francis Ford Coppola. He created a masterpiece but bear in mind, though it is a movie everyone should watch, the slow pace and long length might turn some people off but if you bear with the slow pace then you will absolutely love the film. For being released in 1972 it was a very violent film. It&#39;s also full of symbolism which makes a second or third viewing so much more fun as there&#39;s so many details the director placed into its many scenes.<br/><br/>The Godfather is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. Spanning from 1945 to 1955, it chronicles the Corleone Crime Family under patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss. There&#39;s a huge cast playing these well written characters, also some big names who&#39;re playing them. Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Richard Castellano as Peter Clemenza: a caporegime in the Corleone crime family, Sonny&#39;s godfather, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen: consigliere, lawyer and unofficial adopted member of the Corleone family, John Cazale as Fredo Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams: Michael&#39;s girlfriend and, later, second wife, Richard Conte as Emilio &quot;The Wolf&quot; Barzini: a crime boss of a rival crime family, Al Lettieri as Virgil &quot;The Turk&quot; Sollozzo: an adversary who pressures Vito to get into the drug business, backed by the Tattaglia family. As you see, there are a lot of characters and everyone is extremely well written and some even based on real people. The whole portrayal of the mafia is extremely well done and I&#39;m glad they did the research. Each character has a meaning to the story and there&#39;s some terrific performances in each scene you watch. Thanks to Coppola&#39;s request approximately 90 percent was shot in New York City and its surrounding suburbs, using over 120 distinct locations. The remaining portions were filmed in California, or on-site in Sicily. Shooting on authentic locations made everything so much more realistic and immersive, Francis Ford Coppola used that to tell the story he wanted to tell, and I think it helped a lot for the actors and look for the film.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando&#39;s performance as Vito Corleone is truly and I mean this, among the best performances I have ever seen in my life, I didn&#39;t really find it to be the best on my first viewing but now... Just wow. He deserved that Oscar, without a doubt. Al Pacino is also great, truly terrific but in comparison to his performance in The Godfather Part 2, it&#39;s not as great as it&#39;s literally hard to top that. Though Brando and Pacino deliver some of cinema&#39;s best performances, there are still a lot of others who does some impressive acting performances, one of them being Robert Duvall who are among my favorite actors. Along with Marlon Brando, he and Duvall wear some serious make-up and prosthetics that make them almost unrecognizable. Everyone in the cast does a great job with showing emotion through the use of the facial expressions and I love that, I can&#39;t name everyone but it&#39;s an incredible ensemble cast.<br/><br/>The film won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan, and Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola for Best Director. Since its release, The Godfather has been widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, especially in the gangster genre. I&#39;ll agree fully with that as after rewatching this film for the second time I can only say how beautifully and brilliantly told it is, highest quality of storytelling and visual storytelling. The first time I watched it was in 2015 I believe and I loved it then, and absolute liked it a lot more the second time, it&#39;s a mesmerizing and literally breathtaking 3 hours."
5431,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Citizen Kane ? please, it doesn&#39;t even compare to The Godfather. Wrongfully placed 3rd on the all time greatest list of movies, The Godfather is perfection personified. In today&#39;s high tech and fast paced times, there will never be a movie with such depth, and meaning as the Godfather. Some say it&#39;s a story about crime, but in actuality it&#39;s a story on loyalty and betrayal in a family. About how generations evolve, and particularly about the metamorphosis of Al Pacino&#39;s character Michael Corleone, turned for a straight war hero, to the ruthless leader of the Corleone Family. Coppolla&#39;s vision will forever be labelled his diffinitive work. The saga which is the Godfather is the greatest story ever told, the characters are authentic and the story is timeless. I think those critics must reconsider the final verdict and place The Godfather in it&#39;s rightful place, at the top of the movie mountain."

Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There&#39;s scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don&#39;t forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I&#39;ve seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I&#39;m still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there&#39;s no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I&#39;m crazy."

He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. <br/><br/>But i see some people who don&#39;t mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.<br/><br/>Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece.

The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."

I love all the characters especially Marlon Brando. He had a lot of good advice in this movie for those who refused his offers. Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can&#39;t wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie?

The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it&#39;s also one of it&#39;s strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition.
But then the plot is weak, it&#39;s unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there&#39;s a &quot;part two&quot;, even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive...
Again, and I know it&#39;s not a popular one, this is my opinion."

5271,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo&#39;s 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando). The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[3]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[4] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[5] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[6] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990. On the day of his only daughter&#39;s wedding, Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the Don of a New York crime family. Vito&#39;s youngest son, Michael, in a Marine Corps uniform, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the sprawling reception. Vito&#39;s godson Johnny Fontane, a popular singer, pleads for help in securing a coveted movie role, so Vito dispatches his fear, Tom Hagen, to the abrasive studio head, Jack Woltz, to secure the casting. Woltz is unmoved until the morning he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion. Shortly before Christmas 1945, drug baron Virgil &quot;The Turk&quot; Sollozzo, backed by the Corleones&#39; rivals, the Tattaglias, asks Vito for investment in the emerging drug trade and protection through his political connections. Vito disapproves of drug dealers, so he sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. The family then receives two fish wrapped in Brasi&#39;s vest, imparting that he &quot;sleeps with the fishes&quot;. An assassination attempt by Sollozzo&#39;s men lands Vito in the hospital, so his eldest son, Sonny, takes command. Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen to pressure Sonny to accept his deal. Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on his father at the hospital, but is accosted by corrupt police captain McCluskey, who breaks his jaw; Sonny retaliates by having Tattaglia&#39;s son killed. Michael comes up with a plan to hit Sollozzo and McCluskey that his brother approves over Hagen&#39;s objections: on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael lures the pair to a restaurant, retrieves a planted handgun and murders them. Despite a clampdown from the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare and the brothers fear for their safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister Connie. When it happens again, Sonny speeds for her home but assassins ambush him at a highway toll booth and riddle him with submachine gun fire. Michael&#39;s time abroad has led to marriage to Apollonia Vitelli. Their euphoria is shattered when a car bomb intended for him takes her life. Vito, saddened to learn that, despite his hopes, Michael has become involved in the family business, decides to end the feuds. Believing that the Tattaglias were under orders of the now dominant Don Emilio Barzini, he promises, before the heads of the Five Families, to withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo revenge for Sonny&#39;s murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home and over a year later marries Kay. With his father at the end of his career and his surviving brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising his wife to make the business legitimate within five years. He allows rival families to pressure Corleone enterprises even as he plans to move family operations to Nevada and delegates New York business to members who stay behind. Hagen, upset when Michael replaces him with Vito, is mollified by the older man&#39;s reassurance about their long- range plans for him. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene&#39;s stake in the family&#39;s casinos, Greene derides the Corleones as a fading power. To add injury to insult, Michael sees Fredo falling under Greene&#39;s sway. Vito collapses and dies in his garden while playing with Michael&#39;s son, Anthony. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, signally his treachery as Vito had warned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie&#39;s son, to whom Michael will stand as godfather. As the christening proceeds, Corleone assassins, acting on Michael&#39;s orders, murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is told that Michael is aware of his betrayal and taken off to his death. After Carlo is questioned by Michael on his involvement in setting up Sonny&#39;s murder and confesses he was contacted by Brazen, Peter Clemenza kills him with a wire garrote. Michael is confronted by Connie, who accuses him of having her husband killed. He denies killing Carlo when questioned by Kay, an answer she accepts. As Kay watches warily, Michael receives his capos, who address him as the new Don Corleone."

While it&#39;s a good movie with talented actors, it&#39;s just not as entertaining and solid as other movies that i believe deserve the top ranking. <br/><br/>I enjoyed watching it, and it really doesn&#39;t deserve the 1/10 rating I&#39;ve given it (thats only to bring it lower on the top 250) it just isn&#39;t as good as other movies I have seen and loved such as &#39;Trainspotting&#39;, &#39;Pulp Fiction&#39; and &#39;Donnie Darko&#39; for example. <br/><br/>These movies are solid performances with a strong theme in one direction, while I feel that The Shawshank Redemption flounders around with it&#39;s, slightly lame, hope and friendship theme, thats just not as entertaining as others."

4418,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather has great scenes, classic characters, classic dialogue, and an amusing look into the Italian mafioso, but it&#39;s just a tad bit too long to be perfect, in my opinion as a new viewer. There were many scenes that were riveting and performances that were, at times, mesmerizing, but I just feel like it is a little overrated.<br/><br/>It deserves its due credit, no doubt, for without it, so many great movies and tv shows inspired by it would have never been made, and the ground it therefore broke will always hold its place as one of the greatest movies ever made. Some scenes were just too drawn out, lengthened, or long-winded, and it can therefore become a little bit of a chore to watch and enjoy in one sitting, as good as it can be at certain points.<br/><br/>I can see how when this came out in 1974, it was so popular and how it held up throughout the years to be considered one of the best movies ever made, but in my experience in watching other movies since then of this genre, I can list at least 5 I enjoy at least just as much if not more. Obviously, those films have been inspired by the Godfather so without it they wouldn&#39;t likely exist in the fashion that they do, but they are still better paced, more suspenseful at times, and just more entertaining overall.<br/><br/>This doesn&#39;t mean that the Godfather isn&#39;t a classic and one of the best, but it is a matter of taste, and the Godfather still remains a movie I have to really be in the mood for to sit through. Certain scenes, or parts, of this epic hold up much more than others, while other parts and scenes can feel like a slog to sit through.<br/><br/>8/10"

375,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Stephen King is of course, a gifted storyteller. Maybe this might not be his most personal writing, if you want to read a very insightful book on prison detention and the atrocities and misconducts that exist, read the Star Rover, it is fantastic.<br/><br/>To me, this is filled with far too many shortcuts, basically everything is in hand for Dusfrene to escape. The perfect location, the cell on the extremity of the facility floor, yet we can&#39;t really see where the foundation leads to, apparently it leads into the pipelines. Also the great timing, the fact that he manages to work out taxes, bills, finances for a 100 person, and in charge of the library, and with a rock hammer that he trades from Red, he breaches a cement wall. I don&#39;t get how any of this is realistic - since it&#39;s a King&#39;s series, might as well turn into a fantasy. But it&#39;s incoherent, lacks coherent flow, it intends to empathy with cons who really seem to be very friendly people (sort of), and might be innocent. I&#39;m not sure these people are all quite recommendable and the camaraderie between detainees necessary - it is certainly not the same nature between workers that are part of a union. I fail to understand how a movie can go two hours and then in a span of ten minutes, retrace ten years of escape planning without giving us any hints on where Dusfrene will strike. <br/><br/>The scenes where he is revealed that a mobster murdered his wife and her lover makes no sense, it doesn&#39;t work, I don&#39;t understand it - the scene when he plays opera is tacky - again, this movie reaches. And then of course, a post-modern ending to a movie that is set in the 60s, where two guys meet on the beach, Dusfrene treating a beat up boat. Again, the development reaches, it is just a series of shortcuts that arrange the directors in order to get through it by just being lazy. <br/><br/>The performances are dull, there is hardly any real focus, any real acting, it doesn&#39;t focus enough on the characters, it moves too fast.<br/><br/>This movie just doesn&#39;t work."

Things in movie land would never be the same. This was a great craftsman at work...and The Godfather became a land mark movie. Other films would be compared to the real thing, and very few got anywhere near this original Classic. Its now 40 years later, and were still waiting for a real challenger. Of course--its not going to happen. A movie like The Godfather could never be made today. We have directors who don&#39;t care to even try !! I understand that. It would require vision and a rich talent that skips several generations. It was Coppola who refused to back down when the studio brass wanted Ernest Borgnine for the lead role. He demanded Brando. He got Brando. Brando was great. This is one of those rare movies where all the planets align-----and everything works perfectly.

In fact the main reason that me and my friends don&#39;t refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it&#39;s name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those &quot;Budget Theaters&quot; over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said &quot;That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!&quot; There&#39;s really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... &quot;HOPE&quot;.  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just &quot;comes together&quot; is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a &quot;must buy&quot; for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I&#39;ve seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, &quot;That was a great movie, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as good as &#39;you know what&#39;!&quot;  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my &quot;favorite of all time&quot;, but they&#39;ve all fallen far short of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;. So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You&#39;re guaranteed to find it in the &quot;employee picks&quot; section. And if it isn&#39;t in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven&#39;t bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!"

1160,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I had high hopes for &quot;Shawshank Redemption,&quot; given its lofty reputation as one of the greatest films ever made. However, it failed to live up to even the lowest of expectations. The storyline drags on endlessly, offering little in terms of originality or excitement. The characters are one-dimensional, and the performances lack depth. I found myself constantly checking the time, hoping for some redeeming quality that never materialized. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this overhyped relic of cinema.<br/><br/>Despite its acclaim, &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; feels like a tedious slog rather than a captivating cinematic experience. The narrative unfolds at a snail&#39;s pace, failing to maintain viewer engagement throughout its lengthy runtime. The characters, supposedly complex, come across as caricatures lacking authenticity and depth. Even the supposedly climactic moments fall flat, devoid of emotional resonance. While some may find solace in its themes of hope and redemption, I found them clichéd and uninspired. Ultimately, &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; is a forgettable film that hardly warrants its revered status in cinematic history."
390,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,Kind of movie that makes you feel the art of movie making should never die... It&#39;s the living soul of what we humans would leave after we&#39;re gone. Absolute genius on behalf of all the people involved in it&#39;s making. They have and will keep this art alive through this masterpiece and inspire generations to come. 10 Stars ✨.
2823,tt0068646,The Godfather,"When the Godfather was released in 1972, the golden age of Hollywood was long over. Regardless, this film managed to recall that era while at the same time taking advantage of the ever changing times. This film is darker and more grittier than the films of the thirties and forties as such melancholy was starting to become more common in movies. It definitely didn&#39;t forget its roots however. The popular film noir style is very evident in this film: not just in the lighting but in the dark subject matter and often bleak themes. And the themes of the movie are indeed bleak. In fact, as people are shot, blown up, and have revenge acted upon them, an inexperienced movie viewer might wonder what the point is. The point is, under the violence and hate, there is a wealth of good: total justification for the mayhem. The Mafia may be murderous and revengeful, but they have values, possibly even more values than normal, law biding citizens.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando gives a breathtaking performance as Don Vito Corleone, a man who is vicious and harden, yet you learn to care for the guy and his family enough so that you eventually root for them every time they get their own way. Al Pacino also gives a great performance as Vito&#39;s son Michael, who is different from Vito in many ways. As we learn early on, he could care less about his family&#39;s business yet we know he will most likely be shoved into it eventually. We will then learn if he is able to control his family or if he will develop a lust for power and revenge that will cause him to fail altogether. Questions like this are what keep the film interesting and moving forward.<br/><br/>The well orchestrated characters also help the plot along and at no point do they seem unrealistic: even when they make drastic choices. And this is important since this is a very character driven film. And that&#39;s just one of the many strengths seen here. All great films have multiple strengths and this movie is no exception. Many crime films were made before this film as well as after it. The ones that came before were sometimes weighed down with Hollywood glamor while the ones that came after it were often all flash with no substance: relentlessly violent with no reward in the end for the viewer. The Godfather dodges those weaknesses and it also avoids being pretentious and overblown. Just one of the many things that make The Godfather the best movie of the seventies and possibly the best of all time."
4493,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This film is nothing short of a masterpiece! The writing is amazing, and the directing is top notch. This film has inspired hundreds of filmmakers around the world. The Godfather has an outstanding cast and the script has impressive dialogue. This film is entertaining from start to finish. Francis Coppola&#39;s imagination &amp; vision is laser sharp. I will always keep this film in my movie collection. A must have for every movie lover. I could watch this film over and over again and never get bored because it&#39;s just that great. I enjoy the acting and the score to this film. A classic soundtrack with amazing sound."
1559,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a beloved classic about organised crime, and the Sicilian lifestyles in America. Of course the movie is about the building of a dynasty, a business built on death, murder and betrayal that goes on to run itself on favours and illegal pleasures. However, in this story we see the life of Don Vito Corleone (Played to a tee by the magnificent Marlon Brando), giving favours on his daughter&#39;s Wedding day. Here we see a loving, caring man who is both equally loved and feared. So far in the movie, it has had fair tension and introduced us to the family. Then all of a sudden a film-maker awakens to find his prized race horse&#39;s head under his bed sheets, and suddenly the tensions of this movie rises considerably.<br/><br/>Without really explaining anything else (I mean I really shouldn&#39;t have to), our focus is on the youngest Corleone son Michael (Stunning work from Al Pacino). As a man of considerable morals and high grounds, how far will he be willing to go when push comes to shove? Lets just say &quot;Falls from grace&quot; is a perfect statement, befitting of this rich &quot;Sepia&quot; toned movie.<br/><br/>Something of a Masterpiece when the film came out back in 1972. &quot;The Godfather&quot;, has only gotten better of age. There are so many iconic quotes and moments in the movie, and the cast is just seriously one of the best ever put to film. James Caan I hardly recognised, and Robert Duvall was just as brilliant as always. But obviously the biggest argument is, was this movie Brando&#39;s or Pachino&#39;s? Personally, I thought Brando was just incredible as always, and totally deserved the Oscar he turned down. Both nevertheless are unforgettable on screen.<br/><br/>The pacing was impeccable, as well as the locations that are all shot beautifully. Some part of me does feel that the film is a bit too long, however a lot does happen and instantly captivates you enough to check out the sequels. The music was fantastic, helping bring the era and authenticity out of the picture and into the deepest parts of my brain. I could listen to the &quot;Love theme&quot; all day. As said earlier, the movie is about the dynasty of the family, the business of the family and the vengeance of the family. So many themes are present and so much more are explored. Every gangster film ever made owes something to Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s efforts.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Probably the first modern gangster epic ever made. As director Stanley Kubrick said: &quot;Probably the finest cast ever assembled&quot;. 10/10."
1369,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Does it get much better than this?
After 25 years of watching this, the answer is (so far), &quot;not really&quot;."
4476,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I Think The People Know The Godfather and don Vito Corleone and His Family are more than people Go cinemas godfather trilogy is complex of excellent directing acting writing charactering costume design somebody likes Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption or any Movie But I am Sure All of Them agree with me godfather is Greatest Picture of Cinema for Example Don Vito Corleone is symbol of gangsters no Al Capone or Acting of Al Pacino the Great he change the acting for all of history but a great question is why ford Coppola never back to golden age after apocalypse now. if he repeat masterpieces I am sure he became great director of all time. see the godfather and enjoy it because it is not for 1970s it&#39;s a movie for all time"
3129,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This film was way ahead of it&#39;s time, even to this day it&#39;s still the pinnacle of a masterpiece. Every single element of this is amazing. The cast, the acting, the writing, the settings, the directing... despite it being quite a long film, whereas I am known to be distracted more easily the longer a film is; this film made me hooked on it until the very last second. I just absolutely love the story too, such a well crafted Italian gangster film all about &quot;la familia&quot;.. if you haven&#39;t seen this film yet what are you doing?? Watch it right now!!"
1574,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a &#39;movie buff&#39;. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director&#39;s cut for my entertainment and delight.<br/><br/>All I can say is, there&#39;s 3 hours of my life I&#39;m never going to get back. Don&#39;t get me wrong; I&#39;m a big fan of gangster movies, I&#39;ve studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys&#39; Pet Sounds; 30 years on it&#39;s impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920&#39;s and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.<br/><br/>And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn&#39;t live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it&#39;s twice as pitiful.<br/><br/>The legendary Marlon Brando couldn&#39;t fail to disappoint - the poor man&#39;s legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he&#39;d stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn&#39;t sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino&#39;s &#39;thunderbolt&#39; relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he&#39;s meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.<br/><br/>The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as &#39;hot tempered&#39; by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn&#39;t help it: &quot;Something tells me Apollonia isn&#39;t going to get out of that car&quot; etc. The plot didn&#39;t really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of &#39;an offer they couldn&#39;t refuse&#39;. It was laughable.<br/><br/>Other than Caan&#39;s, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese&#39;s Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you&#39;re laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino&#39;s protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he&#39;s become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.<br/><br/>Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre&#39;s future output."

4345,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This has got to be the single greatest film ever made, the attention given to detail, to acting, to the cinematography, to the overall setting in such a short time was amazing.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone crime family and when he is made an offer by a narcotics dealer Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri). He refuses, however his eldest son Sonny (James Caan) shows some interest in the Narcotics trade, giving Sollozzo and 2 other mob families the opening to take out the Don and make the offer to Sonny, the assassination happens, however Vito lives and it is getting close to a mob war, however Michael (Al Pacino) Vito&#39;s youngest son says that he is ready to have a meeting with Sollozzo and the crooked cop that is protecting him Captain McClusky (Sterling Hayden) which ends up with Mike killing both the cop and the narcotics dealer, with Michael feeling to Sicily a mob war occurs leading us to some tragic and harsh events.<br/><br/>There are a lot of sub-plots, details and major characters that i left out but i was explaining the starting point of this classic.<br/><br/>The film is a portrait on family, the general state of America and the entire point of the character Michael Corleone, the people that claim that The Godfather is not an accurate depiction of the mob did not get the point of the film, this film changed the way films were made, before The Godfather you had to be a Bogart or a Wayne but after this masterpiece the names Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro could star in major motion pictures of a mammoth scale like The Godfather.<br/><br/>It is not only a visual feast it is also the perfect film as the only things wrong with the film were continuation errors, the acting and everything is up to perfect, Francis Ford&#39;s directing was one of the best directorial efforts ever.<br/><br/>This film made a lot of stars packed with some of the greatest acting performances ever given (Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan etc).<br/><br/>10 out of 10 from me."

From acting, to story to the 1940&#39;s set pieces, this film dominates all films. Comon everyone have to admit Marlon Brando&#39;s performance in this film is one of the greatest performance ever in the film history. By the way the score is another element that adds to the greatness of this film, The only word to describe this film is &#39;EPIC&#39; All characters fit in perfectly, the mood/tone is correct for every scene and all actors equally shows their talent fully in this film. The memorable moments such as the Don shooting scene, Sollozzo killing scene! concludes this film to be pure perfection!

It is so great on so many levels. Brandois unbelievable, as the Godfather, and Michael Corleone, the succeeding Godfather is almost as wonderful. Sonny is amazing, and all the other support actors and actresses are. There are so many elements of this film that are wonderful, including all the references to Italian culture, mobster attitudes, and references to respect, revenge, violence, and remorse that will make this a movie that will be remembered forever."

5482,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Compared with the requirement for a literary work to have a sense of picture, the film directly presents the picture. Therefore, the movie can be enjoyed by both elegance and vulgarity, because the picture can be seen by everyone, and the rich soundtrack and soundtrack make the movie this art form Exudes infinite charm. But the movie itself has its own art form and creative technique. Reading the movie itself can better experience the charm of movie art."
3554,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I found the godfather to be slightly growling and over long, however I am not a gangster movie fan. You cannot put the Godfather down for it&#39;s immaculate acting and terrific set design. Marlon Brando was absolutely fantastic and never failed to shock with his brilliant performance. Al Pacino didn&#39;t impress as much as I thought he would, however, he carried off the performance with style. The hidden details within the Godfather are subtle yet enthralling. Attention to detail is duly noted and can be seen in many of the scenes, including where Michael makes his first killing. The change in character is subtle yet powerful and you can&#39;t help but wonder whether he&#39;s doing it because he wants to or because he feels he has to. all in all, The Godfather was a good FILM however I found it slightly dull but may appeal to another audience."

1893,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Overrated movie that romanticizes the mafia. Script is average, the performances and scenography are good, but they don&#39;t wash away the weak script. Don Vito Corleone is just a romanticized and unbelievable mob boss."

Higher than the first by recreating childhood Vito and his subsequent rise in the world of the mafia, played by Robert de Niro, action that would be worth an Oscar masterful, and that would lead to stardom, being considered today one of the best actors of all time, but the best. Al Pacino makes the best performance in the history of cinema. A display of how to act it would enshrine in the film world as one of the best players in history, with a solid film career available to very few. Her performance is masterful, magnificent, powerful as it was in the first, but this far exceeds the. That look like ice shivers when you see it and freezes your blood, penetrates like you two knives stabbing you, this passivity when it is in front of his wife is historical, one of the best images from the history of cinema; also master the kiss with which condemns his brother Fredo, just spectacular ..."

13,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Last week, I had seen &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; and I feel it is one of the best movies ever made, especially in these hard to entertain folks at the movies for $10 a seat times. I couldn&#39;t understand how some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that film.<br/><br/>That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.<br/><br/>
In the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times. Three of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine Coke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn&#39;t warm up to this film. Robbins and Freeman&#39;s acting was good, but I guess the story wasn&#39;t original -- or surprising to me. I just didn&#39;t care about these guys, nor anyone else. It&#39;s prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I get that concept. Sometimes you&#39;re released after serving time, sometimes you&#39;re not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of High School or college I guess. I just don&#39;t care about those folks no matter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn&#39;t care about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing. Snooze.<br/><br/>First I thought, I might not be a big &quot;prison&quot; entertainment fan, but then I remembered one of my favorite films is &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (which I thought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (which was more on King&#39;s level than this) and I actually sat through a few seasons of HBO&#39;s &quot;Oz&quot; which was gritty and scary, to say the least. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If you&#39;re wondering, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; is another.)<br/><br/>The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who didn&#39;t like &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, I find myself here at &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, and now I am able to stand where they were -- for a moment -- in the minority.<br/><br/>All things are not wonderful to all people.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s....a good thing."
2464,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie has everything a masterpiece needs. Excellent writing, compelling characters, and a story worth knowing. It tells of the politics of the Mafia in the 1940s, focusing on the Corleone family. Don Vito Corleone is a smart businessman who decides to refuse to get involved with another family&#39;s connections to the drug business, thinking it to be morally wrong. When an assassination attempt on his life leaves the Boss in a critical condition, his sons must take over the day to day operations in the midst of the war that has been started. Throughout the film we see the truth behind the violence, the stress of being involved with a powerful family, and the political undertones of Mafia life. We especially see all of these effects in Michael Corleone. He is the youngest son of Don Corleone, and a war hero. However, due to the things happening throughout the story, Michael portrays a man&#39;s descent into a different life. Some great things about this movie are first off, the acting. Each person in this movie, no matter how small their role is, has a story to tell and they all tell those stories beautifully. Second, the language. Many scenes in this movie are spoken almost exclusively in Italian. Without subtitles. It added an authenticity unlike any movie I&#39;ve seen before. Beautifully well done, excellently put together, an obvious masterpiece, even with being very slow paced at times. If you have yet to see this film, do so this instant."
352,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman&#39;s Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King&#39;s short story &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot; (in the film version, it&#39;s really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it&#39;s another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn&#39;t want his parole. However, the film&#39;s emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but engrossing and satisfying, &quot;Shawshank&quot; was not a big hit at the box-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from ****"
5456,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Watching this as a kid changed me. I wanted to be a mobster for a while. Cool suits, women and money?! Of Course but once I got older I understood that was a dangerous life but still admired these guys because yes it was a movie but it was someone&#39;s real life also. Almost a bio pic if you will. Amazing movie about the mob, loyal, money, power, family &amp; Respect. The Godfather is one of those all time classics. It almost timeless. This movie was the start of it all. It was eye opening to see how mobsters operated, and the crazy life they lived. I believe this movie is the closest to the real thing you can get."
2754,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, &quot;Is it The Godfather level good or not ?&quot;.<br/><br/>This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn&#39;t find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).<br/><br/>With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.<br/><br/>It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather&#39;s mansion. <br/><br/>All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of &quot;Bravo!&quot;. This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie."

The Godfather is a masterpiece and there will likely never be a movie as good or better than The Godfather"
392,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Based on ratings by users, I can see why this film is rated number 1 on IMDb.<br/><br/>A film about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who claims he was falsely imprisoned. He decides to adjust to life while incarcerated, and befriends a number of his fellow inmates, including Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman). Andy establishes respect among his cohorts and even the prison guards by doing a number of things in improving life in the prison, including expanding a library and helping people do taxes. The men&#39;s friendships grow over the years as try to find, as the IMDb plot puts it, &quot;solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.&quot; This movie is on the longer side, being over two hours long. However, the many elements in this film do not drag, making this movie an intriguing and exciting feature. The plot and subplots were solid, blending together well, and the cast of characters gave a strong, dramatic and memorable performance. There were action, humor, drama, tragedy and hope all mixed in, providing you a very entertaining film.<br/><br/>There are far too many aspects of this film to be mentioned all at once in this review. Therefore, you will have to see and follow this movie for yourself to appreciate it. It is certainly worthy of its seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture (Forrest Gump won that year). A must-see for anybody.<br/><br/>Grade A"
52,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I&#39;m trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You&#39;ll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it&#39;s entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.<br/><br/>Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you&#39;ll discover in &quot;The Shawshank Redemption;&quot; when you watch it, you&#39;ll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you&#39;ll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can&#39;t find in movies today. <br/><br/>Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. <br/><br/>How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn&#39;t get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like &quot;It&#39;s a Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. <br/><br/>Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film&#39;s title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. <br/><br/>But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title."
5611,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a very intense viewing experience. I really liked how they used the bottom lighting so he could not really see who was talking at the beginning, it left a sense of suspense about it. The suspense of what could this person&#39;s business be what is there business what do they do. Why are they coming to the Godfather for help? The other thing I really like about the film is how before he goes to get the gun from the bathroom to shoot the men in the restaurant. When he gets to the bathroom he takes the gun and has to calm himself down, then he goes to shoot the guys and hears the sound of a train right before he does it. I feel that the intensity of the train noise rising as he is about to shoot them was a brilliant choice of thing to do because it shows how he is thinking about it. I do not like how they used low lighting all the time. I get it is a dark type of movie but it does not need that type of lighting like all the time. They could have used neutral lighting because that is not light but not dark at the same time. I feel like that would have worked better because low lighting ended up making the scene look way darker than it had to be. The Godfather was a very good movie and overall it was a very nice movie with an amazing story-line. The way they portrayed most of it was amazing but when they overused some of the lighting is what made me kinda feel off about how some parts of the movie may not be that great. I did like a lot of the sounds in his head."
2640,tt0068646,The Godfather,It&#39;s still one of the most iconic films today.<br/><br/>And it&#39;s fun for modern people to!<br/><br/>So you can watch it with every friend you want.
1920,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie if so we can call it, because is more than a movie, it&#39;s the greatest union of artist, starting with the director finishing with the composer, stepping between the actors. Even if it&#39;s not a movie made by a &quot;true&quot; Sicilian, it smells like Sicily. Coppola presents to non-Sicilian spectator the gloomy charm of &quot;my&quot; arid land. It&#39;s not only a mob-movie but also a film where all the elements are united among them: love, hatred, violence, friendship, betrayals, beauty. From the first scene with a great Salvatore Corsitto as Amerigo Bonasera, to the last scene the film keeps even the reclutantest spectator in a vice of emotions. The evocative images of Sicily and don Corleone&#39;s speeches (and not only...) have made of this movie maybe the most important work in the cinematographic sphere of all times,an icon. In conclusion of this my short review I can say only one thing: I BELIEVE IN AMERICA"
3982,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In other words it is not the greatest film of all time. I cannot stand people who have claimed it to be. It is no where as a good as Shawshank, Alien and definitely is not, and never will be, as good as Taxi Driver. It does have its moments and Al Pacino was brilliant, (no I&#39;m not going to give Marlon Brando a shout out, because he too is overrated) the music is stunning and so is the story but it isn&#39;t very catching I had to space the viewing over a number of days because I couldn&#39;t be arsed watching all at once without felling the urge to watch something else. It rises well but then falls flat on to its face then slowly makes it to it&#39;s knees towards the end. Yet I still find it hard to believe how it is the &#39;best&#39; film ever.<br/><br/>F.Nich"
4641,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The best movie ever made... I think Francis Ford Coppolla&#39;s Godfather is best in all ways of directing,acting,musical,cinematographic... Although it tells a story of everything; i mean so many characters you see in movie and different emotions from all type you feel doesn&#39;t make you away from story.You become part of this life told in movie.<br/><br/>That is a very serious movie about serious things and be sure i am serious too about;Godfather is best!<br/><br/>Another point is the year that film is made.35 years before,making this movie.Just like a dream.<br/><br/>Mario Puzo , writer of the book is a genius who wrote Superman."

Movie is 85% misery and 15% happiness. Dialogues are good. Background score hits at right place.
Watch till the end."
303,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"A fair number of the movies that rank high on this site&#39;s top 250 all time list also share a parallel &#39;life&#39; as literature, so let&#39;s start there.<br/><br/>The book &quot;Rita Hayworth, etc...&quot; is the best of the &#39;Different Seasons&#39; tetralogy. King adhered to the first person perspective, which is a challenge: the narrator can only know what comes into his range of perception. You as the reader have to decide if you trust him, and so on. King wrote this in the early hand-to-mouth period of his existence -- and what do we have? A prisoner who persistently writes to his benefactors for &#39;more funding&#39;.<br/><br/>Darabont didn&#39;t have the skill necessary to really offer anything of artistic value here. We&#39;re stuck with borrowings: parts of &quot;Convict 99&quot;, &quot;Gilda&quot;, &quot;Brubaker&quot;, &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;; musically, the &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot; aria -- it&#39;s actually not a bad bit of self-reference. It&#39;s the only good visual part here, and even that is smothered by the narration; literarily, Dumas&#39; &quot;...Monte Cristo&quot;...<br/><br/>The book does a good job of playing with the readers&#39; expectations and using irony. There&#39;s no preaching. And it ends far more intelligently than this does; the denouement here seems to belong in a different movie altogether.<br/><br/>This isn&#39;t a bad movie; considering the obscene amount of money invested in these things, it&#39;s hard to find a truly bad movie any more -- one with no cinematic value at all -- that wasn&#39;t the case 20 - 30 years ago. <br/><br/>But there&#39;s no way I can love it. It just isn&#39;t the sort of movie that resonates with *me*, because the story is just &#39;there&#39; with no life of its own."

3324,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Honestly this movie is quite mid, its not bad but also not this &quot;best movie of all time ever&quot; that people say it is, my conclusion for that is that people just regurgitate what they&#39;ve heard their nostalgic parents say to seem mature or intelligent.. The pacing in the movie itself is quite stagnant and unengaging after the first thirty or fourty minutes (and this movie goes on for 2 more hours)<br/><br/>I have attempted to watch it on two separate occasions but didn&#39;t find anything particularly interesting or captivating in the plot. This is not the problem of the talented actors or cinematography, because those were alright."
2455,tt0068646,The Godfather,This is barely a masterpiece in my opinion. The direction and acting are completely flawless but it lack a lot in writing compared to what people say. Its pretty enjoyable tho ngl.
4044,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is awesome in every detail . The actors make the best movie ever. The first time I viewed &#39;The Godfather&#39; I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let&#39;s start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, &#39;I believe in America&#39;, it&#39;s crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film&#39;s &quot;threshold&quot;. This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando."
3399,tt0068646,The Godfather,"James Caan, who just passed away, is likewise excellent as the Don&#39;s hotheaded eldest son Sonny whose frequent outbursts provide a great contrast to the measured, reasonable approaches of both his father and Michael and whose very bloody murder provides another of the best scenes in the film. As the title character Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando gives a fantastic performance which afforded him his second and final Best Actor Oscar, though he did not accept it. The Don is a fascinating character. He prides himself on being a man of honour who values loyalty above everything else and has a strict moral code, albeit an extremely warped one. The family business encompasses murder, gambling, bootlegging and widespread political and judicial corruption and yet he refuses to enter the narcotics trade as he thinks that it will be too messy and lose the family its support among the police and politicians. I generally prefer Brando when he enunciates more clearly as opposed to mumbling but he is very frightening as the soft spoken Don. Truly powerful people do not need to shout all of the time and the Don understands this. He seldom loses his temper, using violence as an instrument after a reasonable offer has been refused. He is an incredibly strong and compelling character and Brando&#39;s performance represents some of his best work. Francis Ford Coppola said that he wanted the best actor in the world to play Don Corleone, which meant either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier is one of my absolute favourite actors but I can&#39;t imagine him as the Don.<br/><br/>In his first major film appearance, Al Pacino is excellent as the Don&#39;s youngest son Michael Corleone, another wonderfully compelling character. In his first scene, we are introduced to him as a US Army captain who has just returned from the recently ended World War II. He is the outsider as he is the only member of his family to have attended college and wants no part of the family business. He instead wants a normal life with his girlfriend Kay Adams and this is illustrated by the two of them going Christmas shopping and going to see &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#39;s&quot; - in a funny coincidence, that was the first sequel nominated for Best Picture while &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; was the second - in the cinema. However, everything changes after the assassination attempt on the Don and Michael&#39;s first involvement with the family business when he murders Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, one of the best scenes in the film. He spends several years in Sicily, marries a young woman named Apollonia and sees her killed in a car bomb which was meant for him as part of the ongoing war between the Five Families. This experience hardens him and he begins to lose touch with his humanity. He returns to New York City to find that his family is no longer feared as it once was, given that his father has grown weak. The Corleones relocate to Las Vegas and, under Michael&#39;s leadership, attempt to legitimise the business but this is mocked by the Nevada based gangster Moe Greene, a thinly veiled version of Bugsy Siegel. It could be argued that Michael does not truly become his own man until after his father&#39;s death when he not only establishes himself as the new Don but reestablishes the Corleones as the most feared and powerful crime family. Pacino was deservedly nominated for an Oscar but for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor, which justifiably annoyed him as he had more screen time than Brando. Robert Duvall is extremely good as Tom Hagen, the Don&#39;s unofficially adopted German- Irish-American son and the family&#39;s consigliere who is often the voice of reason. A very young Diane Keaton is impressive in the supporting role of the initially naive Kay, who undergoes a steep learning curve in the brilliant final scene when she realises that Michael was lying when he said that he did not have his brother-in-law Carlo killed. The film has a very strong cast overall: John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Abe Vigoda (along with Brando, one of the few non-Italian-Americans playing one in the film), Richard Conte (who was considered for Don Corleone), Richard S. Castellano, Al Lettieri, John Marley, Alex Rocco and Coppola&#39;s sister Talia Shire. Although Shire is a little over the top in the last scene, she is excellent in the extremely unpleasant scene in which Connie breaks down and Carlo beats her."

5370,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is a good movie but not as great as everyone seems to think.<br/><br/>Certaintly not the number one movie in the top 250. Heat, in fact,<br/><br/>was much better than The Godfather. Pachino&#39;s acting was not so<br/><br/>very good and the plot was slightly sluggish. The whole time<br/><br/>where Pachino is &#39;away&#39; is a blind alley of a plot line and only<br/><br/>serves to kill off his first wife that has no bearing on the plot really.<br/><br/>7/10"
1851,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Imagine a room full of seasoned movie goers and critics. The topic of discussion - what movies are the best ever? And the name that unanimously pops up as a strong contender for the top spot - The Godfather. With an incredible star cast, an incredible director (Francis Ford Coppola) and a strong story (Mario Puzo) this movie surely deserves all the praise that it can get.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a three hour movie based on the life of the Italian American Mafioso based on the original novel written by Mario Puzo, who also has written the screenplay along with Coppola for the movie as well. It stars legendary and highly respected actors namely Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, etc.<br/><br/>What makes Al Pacino&#39;s role particularly tough is the evolution and the development of his character. He starts out as a person who does not want to do anything with the family business and as circumstances change he gradually changes the direction of his life and evolves throughout the movie. And Pacino does it splendidly. Surely his acting skills are not overrated as some might feel.<br/><br/>The story is a depiction of bitter reality, a bitter reality that was already put forward in the novel and made more accessible and imaginable in the movie. Perhaps this also explains why some haters of the movie exist. It does not offer the escape from reality many other movies seem to offer and let us face it - it is not a simple, straight story to understand. Though 3 hours in length, many viewers could watch it over and over again and each time a viewer watches it he might understand it in greater depth.<br/><br/>The direction is near flawless. This is one huge reason why this movie is always critically on the top spot. Incredible research has been done by Copolla and Puzo in depicting the Mafia world. How does a Don think? How does he protect himself by organizing layers and layers within his empire that render him untouchable by the law? How insecure does he feel? What does he consider when he plans a move? How careful does he have to be in every step that he takes? How does he exploit the whole system around him in order to be the one controlling all the strings (please note the puppeteer&#39;s strings in the logo of the movie The Godfather)? These are some of the questions both the movie and the novel try and answer.<br/><br/>For those of you who have read the novel, I am pretty sure most of you will not be disappointed. It is the best example of how best can a movie be made out of a splendid novel! And for those who saw this movie and liked it, I&#39;d suggest that you read the novel as well for it shall explain in even greater depth the subtle details of the working machinery of the Mafia empire. And yes, please see The Godfather 2 as well.<br/><br/>And may I also add in the end that the second part &quot;Godfather 2&quot; is a fulfillment of the first. A must watch for every person who has watched part one.<br/><br/>I am sure that this movie is going to retain the honour of its top spot and critical finesse for many years to come."

1069,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Many reviews talk about how they don&#39;t have words that can describe this movie. I have the perfect word: vanilla This movie is the Toyota Camry of movies. Pleasant, but bland. It doesn&#39;t take any risks, just plays it safe and the result is a pleasant experience, but not a satisfying one. I would have liked to see more risks taken. How about some ground-breaking cinematography? What if some of the characters pushed the envelope a little further? Far enough to be accused of overacting by some? How about a parallel story? How about SEVERAL parallel stories? What about moving the story at a faster pace? The beginning of the movie was really quite slow...There is no reason this movie should be more than 2 hours. I give it only a 7 out of 10 for breaking no new ground. I think this movie fails to distinguish itself in my memory."
2379,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather isn&#39;t just one of the greatest films ever made-it&#39;s the very definition of cinematic perfection. From its opening frame to its haunting final scene, it commands your attention with a quiet, almost regal confidence.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s direction is masterful, guiding every scene with deliberate pacing and visual precision. The storytelling is rich, layered, and full of nuance, unfolding like a great novel. Each viewing reveals something new-whether it&#39;s a line of dialogue, a glance, or a moral dilemma tucked beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone gives one of the most iconic performances in film history-his quiet strength and gravitas define the character. Al Pacino&#39;s transformation from the reluctant Michael to the cold, calculated Don is breathtaking to witness and remains one of the greatest character arcs ever put to screen.<br/><br/>But The Godfather is more than a mob story. It&#39;s about family, power, tradition, and the cost of loyalty. The film doesn&#39;t glorify violence-it explores the burden and consequence of wielding influence in a corrupt world. Nino Rota&#39;s score is hauntingly beautiful, and the cinematography captures both the intimacy and the menace of the Corleone world with a painter&#39;s eye.<br/><br/>There&#39;s a reason The Godfather is still revered decades later. It&#39;s not just a film-it&#39;s a legacy. A towering achievement that continues to influence filmmakers and captivate audiences with its complexity, elegance, and sheer storytelling brilliance."

It&#39;s been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I&#39;ve given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn&#39;t break my streak.<br/><br/>I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who&#39;ve yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.<br/><br/>Not much can be said about the actors that hasn&#39;t been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I&#39;ve only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I&#39;m sure the same can be said for him.<br/><br/>Though I don&#39;t agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.<br/><br/>9/10"
741,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I personally think that the way this movie touches me cannot be put into words. The core of this movie is hope: hope that overcomes every obstacle placed in your way, the knowing that the wronged people in life can triumph over evil. This is what Andy Dufresne achieves, and the tag line of &quot;Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free&quot; is perfect The underlying theme is friendship, and Andy and Reds friendship is perfectly portrayed here by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. They are both fine actors, and I feel here they give career best performances(although Morgan Freeman is generally good in everything). Morgan Freeman should of won an Oscar for his subtle approach to this role - surely his million dollar baby Oscar is a belated one for this movie too? The directing, the story and everything combine to make this a special movie - don&#39;t worry, the ratings in the all time list, which always put this movie in the top 5, are not wrong. This is a movie everyone must see!!!"

3751,tt0068646,The Godfather,I first watched this movie a few months ago and I loved it. I decided to watch it since I had heard it was one of the best movies ever made. And I now agree with those who said that. I thought that this is one of the best movies as it was well scripted and the characters were strong. Francis Ford Coppola casted some of the best actors for this movie.<br/><br/>The first time I watched it I loved it but I had to watch it a second time as I didn&#39;t get what some of it was about. But from the first time I watched this movie I knew it was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Some people say that is is overrated but in my opinion you could not overrate The Godfather no matter how hard you try. But that is my opinion.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando did an amazing job portraying Don Corleone and he made me want to watch this movie over and over again as he just amazed me with his brilliant acting. Al Pacino gave an astounding performance as Michael Corleone and it is this film that made him my favourite actor. James Caan wowed me as Tom Hagen and his character was one of my favourites in The Godfather.<br/><br/>I loved this film and I could watch it over and over again and not get bored. In my opinion this movie is a definite must see.<br/><br/>I hope this review helped you.

4607,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I finally finished watching The Godfather (1972) for the first time ever and I absolutely loved it. This movie is officially in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>Positives for The Godfather (1972):
This movie literally has everything that I love about cinema and it is absolutely glorious. Everything from the direction, screenplay, writing, story, editing, pacing, sound design, score, production value, set design, costumes, cinematography and acting are all perfect from the very beginning to the end credits. Theacting from the entire cast is phenomenal and every character in this movie was perfectly casted. Vito Corleone is one of the greatest movie characters in cinematic history and Marlon Brando gives one of the greatest acting performance in all of cinema. I also loved Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Richard Castellano as Peter Clemenza, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams-Corleone and Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Tessio. I could honestly talk about everyone else in this movie, but I would say the same thing over and over again because they are all that damn good in this movie. The movie is almost 3-hours of characters having conversations in different settings throughout the runtime and for some people that could be very boring, but in here it is all done masterfully by director Francis Ford Coppola. I was so invested and engaged with all of these conversations during my viewing experience because again everyone is perfectly casted in this movie and the dialogue is some of the best I&#39;ve heard in any movie that I&#39;ve watched in my entire life. This movie also manages to be perfectly paced with its almost 3-hour runtime. The shootouts, violence and kill sprees in this movie are all staged perfectly and while it may seem tamed compared to modern day movies like the John Wick Franchise or literally any horror movie in existence, Francis Ford Coppola did a spectacular job at making these scenes very effective. And finally as someone who watched The Offer (2022) online back in 2022, it is truly amazing how this movie ended being as good as it is especially given all of the drama that went on during the development and production of this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, The Godfather (1972) has both earned and deserves its legendary status as a landmark in cinema over 50 years later. For anyone who hasn&#39;t watched this movie yet, you need to do so as soon as possible because this is one of those movies that needs to be watched by everyone. The Godfather (1972) is one of the greatest movies in cinematic history and it is one of my favorite movies of all time."
4850,tt0068646,The Godfather,"First of all some positive things :-
The background music supported visuals so well and create a retro or soothing feeling in start.<br/><br/>The most impressive thing is POLITICS between five dons. How hierarchy changed, internal conflicts, never trust anyone, strategies and tactics - and all political stuff is here.<br/><br/>Character development is also good with story plotting.<br/><br/>Now some negative things :-
The biggest negative point of this movie is its length of 3hrs as i have not a habit of that much sitting and fixing my eyes on screen.<br/><br/>There are no subtitles provided while speaking Italian.<br/><br/>There are some minor mistakes, but i think that can be easily ignored.<br/><br/>And as i said i don&#39;t usually watch movie of that much length that&#39;s why, if you can&#39;t put brain on even one scene properly- then it becomes confusing.<br/><br/>That&#39;s all from my side .. hope you like it."
563,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption has you hooked from the very first scene. Although Andy&#39;s innocence was obvious from the beginning, you just think how he&#39;s going to get out of it.<br/><br/>For me, the power and depth in this movie was it&#39;s ability to make prison life and friendships look better than that on the outside. Also when they were finally released they were so hesitant to live on the outside and wanted to go back in. I&#39;m not sure why this affected me so much but i think it&#39;s just the fact that one mistake forced these people to live in a certain way where they don&#39;t want so much freedom and they&#39;re used to being workers with no rewards. They just couldn&#39;t adapt to the outside world. As if it were a different planet or something.<br/><br/>Although the men are supposed to be &#39;cold hearted killers&#39;, they seem so nice and are so easy to sympathise with. I know it sounds lame to feel sorry for a killer or thief but i think that the amazing story and acting, had me hoping that all of the prisoners were innocent... except for some obviously. Not to mention the guards were so mean and rude i just wished they would all get punished and tortured at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>If someone can feel that passionate and involved in a movie the first time they&#39;ve seen it...i think it&#39;s a sign that if the person reading this still hasn&#39;t...they should. The Shawshank Redemption most definitely deserves its spot on the IMDb top #250."
5220,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I think this film shown different believes between one man, that i think was a good mad in this film, and all of world as rule of out side people"
9,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.<br/><br/>Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.<br/><br/>And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins&#39; best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman."
742,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This is a movie to be watched over and over.  Each time I get a little bit more out of it.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have a great chemistry together.  Many people do not realize that this movie was based on a Stephen King (one of my favorite authors) novel, &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot;, especially since it is not of the horror/sci-fi genre. I was really glad to see this one at the top of the list."
1376,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This is a story about patience, maturity, character, salvation, and ultimately about finding humanity in a place where there is none. Although its subject matter may be depressing, the story actually contains a lot of warmth, humor and friendship - a buddy story cloaked in a philosophical discourse on the importance of retaining a sense of personal worth and hope no matter what the circumstances.<br/><br/>This adaptation of a 1982 Stephen King novella did lukewarm box office, in part because of an advertising campaign that offered no clue as to what the movie was about, and in part because it never played on more than 970 screens. Still it garnered seven Oscar nominations, including a Best Picture nod, and finished up at a respectable $30 million.<br/><br/>Set in mid-1940s Maine, this is the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is tried and falsely convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison, where he meets a canny lifer named Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman), and a caravan of colorful characters.<br/><br/>The story begins with Red and his fellow inmates watching the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red narrates the story from within the walls of the prison.<br/><br/>Whereas some Stephen King adapters have seemed intent on transcending or trashing their source material, writer-director Frank Darabont succeeds through fidelity to the text; the few deviations make this subdued male love story even more audience-friendly. The film sports elegant cinematography by Roger Deakins, a poignant score by Thomas Newman, solid portrayals and characterizations by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, and an excellent supporting cast including James Whitmore (as old-timer Brooks Hatlen) and William Sadler as a con who starts out scary and ends up lovable."
3182,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This in my opinion is the top of must watch list. The drama, the story-line, the twist, and everything about it sets the benchmark of movies of today."
1935,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Having seen this movie many years ago I sat to re-engage and watched again. I cannot understand the hype about this movie. I think that people hear that its the best movie made then automatically accept this opinion and convince themselves it is. The scene with the horses head was ridiculous really. Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don&#39;t even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface. Sorry but this never gripped me at all.Am I right in thinking Brando changed his looks,size and accent many times during this?"
2435,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This must be the best movie I&#39;ve seen. I watched this movie for over 5 times. Every scene and clue are useful. Those complicated relationship built a web for the fate of the chosen boy, which finally taught him to grow up as a grown man.
I love this movie"
877,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,The Shawshank has one of the greatest messages of all time. Hope. Hope is the idea of believing in yourself or others. It helps you get motivated and helps you persevere. You see Andy dufrine getting wrongly accused and going to prison there he meets his mates and learns each and every one of them he studies the people the ward. at the end a miracle happens I&#39;ll try not spoil it. Overall I&#39;ve seening this movie as a 13 year old really helps your mind. Too many teenagers are being depressed every single day. I want to tell them hey see this movie it will help you. Oh well no one likes my movie taste.
5286,tt0068646,The Godfather,One of the great American Classics. Expresses what family is all about. Well thought out and ambitious. Each scene is amazing and filled with drama.
215,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is often hailed as a cinematic masterpiece-and for good reason. Adapted from Stephen King&#39;s novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film weaves an extraordinary tale of hope, perseverance, and friendship, transcending the confines of its prison setting to touch the very essence of the human spirit. It is not merely a film; it is an enduring piece of art that resonates with universal themes, offering inspiration and motivation to audiences worldwide.<br/><br/>A Journey of Redemption:
The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary. In prison, Andy befriends Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman), a seasoned inmate known for his ability to procure contraband. Over the course of two decades, Andy&#39;s quiet resilience, intellect, and unyielding hope transform not only his life but the lives of those around him.<br/><br/>Performances: A Showcase of Talent
Tim Robbins delivers a career-defining performance as Andy Dufresne, embodying quiet strength and unrelenting optimism. Morgan Freeman&#39;s portrayal of Red is nothing short of iconic; his warm, introspective narration lends the film its soul. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is electric, making their friendship the emotional core of the film.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the corrupt warden Norton and Clancy Brown as the brutal Captain Hadley, adds depth to the story, creating a vivid tapestry of life within Shawshank.<br/><br/>Themes: Hope as a Beacon
At its heart, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope-its power to sustain, transform, and ultimately liberate. Andy&#39;s unwavering belief in a better future, symbolized by his escape and the iconic poster of Rita Hayworth, serves as a reminder that the human spirit can overcome even the darkest circumstances.<br/><br/>The film also explores themes of friendship, justice, and institutionalization. Red&#39;s journey from a man resigned to his fate to one who dares to hope mirrors the transformative power of Andy&#39;s optimism.<br/><br/>Technical Brilliance:
Roger Deakins&#39; cinematography is another highlight of the film. From the claustrophobic interiors of the prison to the breathtaking final scene on the shores of Zihuatanejo, Deakins captures both the despair and beauty of Andy&#39;s journey. Thomas Newman&#39;s hauntingly beautiful score complements the visuals, evoking a spectrum of emotions-from sorrow to triumph.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A Testament to Cinema&#39;s Potential
The Shawshank Redemption is more than just a film-it is an experience, a meditation on life&#39;s struggles and the power of the human spirit. It reminds us that redemption is always within reach, and that even in the bleakest circumstances, hope can shine as a guiding light.<br/><br/>This timeless classic reaffirms the transformative power of cinema, making it a must-watch for anyone seeking inspiration, motivation, or simply the joy of witnessing a perfect piece of storytelling.<br/><br/>&quot;Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.&quot;
With that simple yet profound message, The Shawshank Redemption cements its place as one of the greatest films ever made."
3839,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Spoiler WARNING<br/><br/>Television takes a pretty bad rap.  It is often derided for its stultifying properties, engendering of abject values and overall ability to vitiate the masses.  Many even claim that it foments a sundering influence over families.  I suppose there is some merit to such an assertion, but I can tell you that when I was growing up the TV was the node in which our otherwise fragmented family coalesced.  I guess we would be referred to as `dysfunctional&#39; today; my father didn&#39;t talk to us much and the dinner table was a surface in which to set the groceries until they were put away.  If my parents did ask about how school went, a laconic `alright&#39; would satisfy. But when we sat in front of that glowing cynosure, with its exogenous felicity and fruition, our reticence faded into commentary.  Somehow the factitious world contained in that electronic box inspired us to notice each other.  We watched and we talked.<br/><br/>
So when it was deemed that I was mature enough to watch the network premier of `The Godfather&#39; I was not only anticipating a good movie, I was looking forward to family bonding. I positively loved to listen to my father and older brothers (I&#39;m the baby) engage in dialogue and repartee in response to the TV.  Their insight brought more to light than my young mind could comprehend with just the presentation as is, and I felt edified as well as inclusive.  Hey some folks have the visits to Yellowstone, I have this.<br/><br/>
Even though it was too much for an adolescent to fully appreciate, I knew then that this movie was something special.  And as I grew older I watched it every time it aired.  Of course after videos arrived this was the first movie I purchased.  It is the crème de le crème of films, of which I have watched at least 50 times.  It is a work of art that I can call a masterpiece without a bit of hyperbole.  It is my opinion the greatest picture ever made.<br/><br/>
Though a substantial portion of the film takes place in Sicily, and many customs of that land (as well as cabala) are featured this is a very American story.  It is no less than a stunning examination of the dichotomy that is success in the land of opportunity.  It is a tale of the fine line between legitimacy and profligacy in the capitalist world, of the gray area that exists between transgression and ignominy.  And if the film is a treatise on the American way then the opening line, `I believe in America&#39;, is its exordium.  With those prefatory words Coppola sets the tone.<br/><br/>
What follows is a congeries of dexterous camera shots, first-rate dialogue, incredible acting, untiring character development and one hell of a story. The juxtaposition of criminality and family honor/personal loyalty is achieved with utmost precision.  The motif of personal rectitude vis-à-vis societal ethos pervades the film.  The main characters embody this paradox. They are vicious yet decorous, violent yet urbane, heartless yet not without code.<br/><br/>
The actors are at their best.  Brando providing gravitas, Cann relishing his bellicose role, Keaton appearing to live her enduring conflict.  It is Pacino of course who must steer the course, as his permutation is unveiled before us.  Pacino achieves this vicissitude with a subtlety that resembles an insidious whisper, inaudible to those who underestimate him.<br/><br/>
If you will allow me an indulgence I would like to comment on the outstanding ending to this work.   At times movies are often beloved for memorable scenes.  The finale of this tale is as piquant as they come. Coppola understands the power of the doorway, and the shot of Kay&#39;s face, overcome with the realization of her husband&#39;s duplicity, as the door closes, symbolically shutting her out of his life, is sheer pathos.  Did I mention that I love this ending?  In fact the par excellence of this conclusion has soured me on the sequels.  I have watched them and think they are great, but I do not possess them and never will.  Any extension of this saga is a reproach to this superb terminus ad quem.<br/><br/>
`The Godfather&#39; is a film that must be watched numerous times to absorb and appreciate the many names, nuances, and instances.  I highly recommend it."
3189,tt0068646,The Godfather,"A musician lives with his wife in a small house in Dallas, Texas. They are looking for a new home and planning their move. She tells him that before she moves away from a place, she likes to hide a note for herself there, in case she ever returns. They occasionally hear strange noises in the house; one night they hear a loud bang in their living room, which contains a piano that came with the house. They cannot find the source of the noise.<br/><br/>The next morning, the husband is killed in a car accident in front of their house. At the hospital, his wife views his body before covering it with a sheet. The man awakens as a ghost, still covered in the sheet, and wanders through the hospital, invisible to others. A door of light opens before him, but he makes no attempt to approach it, and it closes. He walks home and watches his wife grieve. The seasons change. Through a window, he sees another sheet-covered ghost inside the house next door; the two ghosts wave to one another.<br/><br/>One night the wife arrives home with a man, whom she kisses. The ghost makes lights flicker and knocks books from a shelf. Later, as the wife listens to a song by her late husband, she recalls listening to it with him. She eventually decides to move out. Before she leaves, she writes a short note and hides it in a gap in a wall. The ghost picks at the gap but cannot retrieve the note."
2695,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>To call &quot;The Godfather&quot; a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie many times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again. Rewatching it recently on 4K UHD disk kinda blew me away the fact of how incredible it looks.<br/><br/>There isn&#39;t anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn&#39;t said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.<br/><br/>Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it&#39;s a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.<br/><br/>Overall, because you have probably already seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that a cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years."

25,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Well I guess I&#39;m a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I&#39;ve seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, &quot;The Godfather&quot; was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I&#39;ve come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like &quot;On The Waterfront&quot;, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest&quot;. I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don&#39;t mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it&#39;s pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen&#39;s release and new prisoner Tommy&#39;s introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy&#39;s quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man&#39;s confinement for a crime he didn&#39;t commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967&#39;s &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;, but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.<br/><br/>But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that &#39;hope can drive a man insane&#39;.<br/><br/>I really can&#39;t recommend this picture highly enough, both for it&#39;s masterful story telling and it&#39;s technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that&#39;s virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance."
5662,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The best movie ever made in this genre. Among these three, the first part of the film was better than all of them. The brilliant performance of Brando and Pacino was one of the best."
5325,tt0068646,The Godfather,Is really cool. iliked it it was nice very good job oh
2739,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Just an amazing movie with an awesome script! One of the best stories ever told. The way this story is told is something that I couldn&#39;t expect, with so much drama but also the reality of that world. We feel so connected with the family, with the characters. The photography increase the drama of the movie. Like the last take, we want so much to see how his going to be with all that power. Absolutely worth watching this movie, especially. You are learning from the very best. It&#39;s also the kind of a movie that every time that I watch I can see something different. Very honest with the book. Almost three hours that we can&#39;t feel. I wish there were more movies like this these days."
885,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Let me start by saying that I always enjoy watching this film. It is perhaps one of the ultimate Hollywood feel-good movies. However, to call a film one of the greatest of all time, you need to compare it with many films of all types, and from many sources. This film is above average Hollywood fayre, and does indeed look very good compared to most of the over-hyped brain-disengaged tosh Hollywood produces.<br/><br/>I am suspicious of most film top 100&#39;s, 10&#39;s etc etc in any case. They are as much a reflection of the average age and experience of those voting than any intrinsic value of the film.<br/><br/>Withouit wanting to be disrespectful, anyone who feels this film uniquely opens their eyes to certain fundamental truths about the human condition, would do better watching Sondeburgh&#39;s highly accessible, but more profound exploration on love, loss, faith, hope and redemption &quot;Solaris&quot;. The adventurous might also check out Tarkovsky&#39;s 1972 Russian version!"
5386,tt0068646,The Godfather,"If there&#39;s one film for which the phrase &quot;best ever made&quot; seems like a massive understatement, it&#39;s The Godfather. This film is pretty much as close to cinematic perfection as you can possibly get. From the very first moments, with its beautiful theme playing on trumpets, it hooks you and doesn&#39;t let go for the next three hours. The opening is possibly the best I&#39;ve ever seen: the first thirty minutes does an incredible job of establishing the setting, characters, and plot points, major and minor, all through dialogue and interactions. From there, it&#39;s a roller coaster of exceptional storytelling and character development that&#39;s endlessly captivating. And at its heart is the story of one man&#39;s rise to power coupled with the start of his fall from grace. Michael starts out as an honest man who wants nothing to do with the family business. But, as their enemies move in on them, he gets roped into that world in the worst way. After seeing the ugliness therein, he makes plans to make the family legitimate, but starts to go too far in his methods of doing so, starting a downward spiral that only gets worse as the series progresses. It&#39;s a brilliant character arc that I could probably talk for hours about.<br/><br/>It&#39;s astonishing to think that Marlon Brando had to fight to be allowed to even be in this movie, because he was truly born for it. He doesn&#39;t just play Vito Corleone, he is Vito Corleone, giving him a humble, gentle, yet subtly threatening performance that&#39;s easily one of, if not the best, acting job I have ever seen. Al Pacino, a personal favorite, excels as Michael, perfectly showcasing his growth as a character. The later scenes in particular are where he truly shines; all he needs to do is flash that signature glare of his and you know there&#39;s trouble waiting. James Caan really should have won the Oscar for his incredible performance. And the rest of the cast is fantastic too. What really makes the performances work, at least in regards of the actors who play the Corleones, is that they truly feel like a genuine family, in more ways than one.<br/><br/>From the opening pan out of the old man telling the Don his story to the final shot of Diane Keaton&#39;s disturbed look at what her husband&#39;s become, Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s direction is absolutely incredible. Every scene, every shot, every edit instantly grabs your attention and leaves you wondering what will happen next. The film is chock full of memorable moments, catchy music, and endlessly quotable dialogue. And it all leads up to a scene that still gives me chills every time I watch this film: the baptism scene. The music, the editing, the buildup and payoff, and the juxtaposition of this sacred ritual against all the horrors being committed at the same time make for a scene that&#39;s absolutely flawless and easily a top ten favorite. For the record, I actually got to see this film in theaters a couple of years ago for its fiftieth anniversary, and it was beyond worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Overall, I think I&#39;ve more than said all I needed to say about The Godfather. It&#39;s without a doubt one of my all time favorite movies, well deserving of its legendary status and I truly can&#39;t recommend it enough."
1975,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is a Good movie for everyone to wacth it, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10."

4039,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a masterpiece in terms of cinematic achievements which boasts near flawless acting most notably from Brando at his scene stealing best. The film is brought to life with a strong script and a haunting score from Nino Rota. If you care for films, make sure you get out and see this. It is brutal without being unnecessarily graphic and moving without being unnecessarily sentimental. We build up a fantastic relationship with the characters and we care an awful lot when something important happens to them. It has been said that this film &quot;gets better as time goes on&quot; but I am not so sure of this as the general taste of the audience is not for this kind of film. It is a refreshing break from the mind-numbing trauma that is Transformers and other heartless Hollywood Blockbusters. One of the greatest films of the 70s? No. One of greatest films of all time!"

5289,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a classic and easily one of the best crime films ever released. It boasts a colorful host of characters, amazing plot twists within its sprawling storyline and impressive cinematography. The movie is a true epic that can stand the test of time. The success of &quot;The Godfather&quot; as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job.<br/><br/>The Guardian&#39;s review states that The Godfather is a brutal sweep of magnificent storytelling. The original will always have the edge in its simplicity, clarity and brutal power."
4027,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I consider this movie as one of the best movies of all time and used to watch it on tv and I was really excited to re-watch the 50 years old movie in cinema ! And to be honest this is the best re-release I have ever seen.<br/><br/>50 years old movie with better quality than modern some modern movie
Recommendation: go and watch it in the cinema..it&#39;s a masterpiece hands down."
1399,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is an exciting and very emotional excursion. It is the best &quot;jail&quot; movie ever made, for sure. There&#39;s suspense, surprises, and more, but it&#39;s true greatness is in it&#39;s show of the human spirit triumphing over impossible odds. With a pair of great actors and a very nice script, The Shawshank Redemption winds up getting a 10/10 from me."

577,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I tell you my voice sailed higher and farther than anybody in a grey place dares to dream to see my favorite movie still reigning at the number 1 spot on the top 250. Redemption, now let me see, I don&#39;t think I know what that means, to tell you the truth that&#39;s a politicians word. What do you really want to know, does redemption happen in this film, well yeah, I don&#39;t have it stuffed down my pants right now, sorry to say but I&#39;ll tell you.  I suggest you just get busy livin or get busy dyin before you find out how salvation lies within. I have to remind myself that some films aren&#39;t meant to be caged and kept to yourself, that there&#39;s something inside that they can&#39;t touch, i&#39;m talking about hope. Those who know Shawshank best talk about it often, but its that much more drab and empty now that its gone out of theaters.  It&#39;s not easy peasy japanesey any more, its more like skin burning and half blind from that delousin stuff they throw on you. It looked at first like a stiff would blow it over, but that was my first impression of the film. There&#39;s nothing left but all the time in the world to think about why you haven&#39;t seen Shawshank yet.  From now on I&#39;ll write two comments a day about this film instead of one."
4852,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is more than a crime movie; it&#39;s a profound exploration of power, loyalty, and moral decay within the top or influential families. It reflects the dark side of the old American Dream, revealing how ambition and survival can blur the line between business and crime. Through the Corleone family, the film exposes the contradictions of power and the need to protect one&#39;s family while destroying others to maintain influence.<br/><br/>While the storytelling is amazing, some scenes feel a bit too stretched. Some of the acting also lean toward theatrical performances at times, creating a sense of stage-like intensity rather than natural realism.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe it&#39;s a 7/10 based on the plot, acting, and more. It&#39;s not a 100% perfect work but at the same time, not bad, or average."
2488,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Well, to say something about this movie is rather easy because you know that every single serious movie-goer would agree that this is one (I would say THE ONE) of the best movies ever made in heaven or hell. Then why should I comment on this one? Because this is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE and I want to make that clear...  :)"

2305,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a classic movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It&#39;s about a mobster family where the whole family is involved except one, because he&#39;s a college student. The family didn&#39;t want to involve him because he had a good educated head on his shoulders. When his father is out one day, there is a mafia hit on him; however things don&#39;t go as planned exactly. Long story short, the dad ends up in the hospital and the educated son feels the need to get involved and help his father out. To my surprise, the son who didn&#39;t want to be involved finds himself completely wrapped up in the mafia lifestyle. <br/><br/>Shockingly due to previous mob movies that were not as popular with the box office, Paramount Pictures was very hesitant to adapt this film. It was a good thing they did because this was the start up to many successful mob movies. Mario Puzo is the author of the book &quot;The Godfather&quot; and thanks to the success from the book, the movie was able to be produced. In my opinion, I love the cast. Al Pacino is an amazing actor and he is known for mafia movies. I was shocked to find out he was almost fired from being in this movie! I can&#39;t imagine what it would have been like without him. All of the cast took their roles really seriously and met a lot of mobsters to really get the feel of the role.<br/><br/>One of the most important thematic elements is the very first scene when the bride&#39;s dad goes into the room to ask a favor from the Godfather. This is important because it shows how respected and powerful the Godfather really is. That scene was really good for character development and plot. Italian lifestyle is a big part in this movie and one of the ways its portrayed is through the language. Throughout the movie there are some parts that are fully in Italian. Even if you&#39;re not Italian after watching this movie you&#39;ll be sure to feel like you are. Violence is a big thematic element in this movie. It is constantly happening in almost every other scene. Violence and death are big parts in the Italian/ mafia lifestyle and thats how it always was and always will be. <br/><br/>A very important scene happens right off the bat, Coppola didn&#39;t waste anytime! The father is shot, and was supposed to be killed. This is the motivation for the sons change of heart and priorities in life. Another important scene is when Michael goes to visit his father in the hospital bed. While he&#39;s in here he has his eureka moment and saves his fathers life. All in the same five minutes another important scene takes place. As Michael was leaving the hospital he runs into a dirty cop who is also in touch with the mafia, and there is an altercation, you&#39;ll have to watch to see what happens next! When Michael gets up his confidence, another crazy scene takes place. Michael became sneaky and learned the ways of the mafia. He goes into a sit down with the guys that are above him on the mafia ranking and when he goes to the bathroom he takes the gun that he planted prior to the sit-down and kills all the men at the table. Obviously this is a key point because it shows Michael&#39;s growth. The last important scene happens after a lot of deaths take place. There is really no one left in the family so the responsibility of running the family business falls into Michael&#39;s hands. <br/><br/>This movie has a lot of story lines which only makes the movie more interesting. Obviously the mafia is a big one. In the first minute were in the room with the Godfather, the boss. Another storyline that unfolds is family relationships. The son, Michael didn&#39;t want anything to do with the mafia but once his father got involved he had to do what was right and stand by his father and help out anyway possible. Business is another storyline that keeps the movie moving. The Godfather&#39;s famous line is &quot;I&#39;m going to make you an offer, you can&#39;t refuse.&quot; Every time the Godfather says this you know some type of business exchange is about to go down.<br/><br/>I think the director did an amazing job of putting all of these story lines together. There was never a dull moment in the film from the first five minutes to the last. It wasn&#39;t like he added unnecessary scenes or additional story lines to make the movie more interesting, everything had a purpose and had me at the edge of my seat the whole three hours!<br/><br/>The most important relationship that is developed in this film is the relationship between Michael and not only his father, but the whole family. He was always the outcast of the family because he never wanted to live the Italian lifestyle but as the movie rolls on, he becomes closer and closer to the lifestyle and more importantly, his family. By the end of the movie Michael&#39;s life becomes the whole family business, and let&#39;s just say there&#39;s a new Godfather in town."
2222,tt0068646,The Godfather,"What more could be said about the Godfather (1+2). The legacy of mafia crime family dramas begins and ends here. The lines of dialogue have been forever embedded into the American culture and film discourse. Pacino, Brando, Dinero, Keaton, Caan, and the whole cast fit the bill with impeccable conviction.<br/><br/>The morals and themes of the pictures have such a profound impact unlike any preceding film. It empathizes with a traditionally antagonistic side of society and shows its varying dimensions. Men who steal, rob, and murder do so for reasons other than their own personal self-indulgence. They believe &#39;the life&#39; is for the greatest benefit for their family, but then take it too far. <br/><br/>Films up to this point had a narrow view of the motivation of the accomplices in organized crime. The Godfathers enlightened the film going public about the motivations of the mafia, crime and crime families but doesn&#39;t defend it. It merely observes the chosen and or inherit ethics of life in the crime family."
3671,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I am glad to see that I am not the only one that just does not &#39;get&#39; this movie. It is spoken of almost religiously,and it seems that if you dare ask &#39;why?&#39;,your sanity is questioned. Maybe people are overwhelmed by the big-name cast,and have been told so many times what a great movie this is, for so long, and are afraid to say different. All I know is that I heard and read endless,over-the-top praise for this movie for years and years. I managed to avoid seeing it until well over a decade after it was released. What a disappointment. I could not believe I was watching the same movie that I had heard so,so much about. I was absolutely astonished with how boring it was. I could not believe how disjointed it was. I could not believe the praise that Marlon Brando was given for such a weak,lackluster performance- it is goofy beyond parody.
As the film rambled and shambled along,I began to wonder if I was the victim of some sort of obscure joke-this crummy film could NOT be the same movie I had heard so much about. Unfortunately,somehow,
the universally-praised movie and this boring and bloated bomb I was seeing turned out to be one and the same.
Watch it on a rainy day and decide for yourself if this movie is worthy of all the hype."
2041,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Prometheus, gave fire to humanity, a cherished and imperative gift for a foolish civilization that much needed it. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo also gave a gift to humanity, a gift that should be the object of study of film students, an epic and dramatic visual tale for film lovers, and an incentive to appreciate cinema in its brightest and purest form for those who are willing to forget their lives for a little under 3 hours.<br/><br/>The Godfather never gets old, and I believe it never will. It has withstood the test of time and never truly feels like a film of over 40 years of history. At times, this masterpiece begins to resemble fine wine, seemingly acquiring a better taste as it ages on.<br/><br/>Its dialogue profoundly feels like discourse directly taken from the streets of New York at the beginning of the century. The cinematography and the acting feel exceptionally natural, and along with a cohesive and coherent pacing, these components make the flow of the film feel like a river in its calmest days: smooth, beautiful and noble. Every shot in the film faithfully serves a greater purpose; every shot feels like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that never breaks apart.<br/><br/>The ambition of the storytelling surpasses, I believe, its own expectations. It provides a sense of wonder, of fascination, nothing short of admiration. Despite having seen the film for over easily 30 times, every time I place my eyes and ears over that glorious opening scene, I can&#39;t help but feel like a child going to the beach for the first time, or a teenager going on a road trip; I feel a roller-coaster under my seat in its peak, waiting slowly to descend into the sublime. Very few stories can relate in terms of value.<br/><br/>The characterization manifests itself over the course of a film in brilliant ways, exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of every one of its characters superbly. Even the minor characters have moments of spectacle. The motivations of each character come to life in outstanding takes, and not one of them ever truly feels expendable.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a colossus, perhaps the summit of filmmaking. It is something every individual can appreciate, from its little details to its grand climax. It is something to be remembered for generations to come. It is something that will likely be unmatched for a great many years."

2128,tt0068646,The Godfather,"RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, &quot;The Godfather&quot; stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.<br/><br/>MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, who&#39;s basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton &amp; Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael&#39;s American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the &quot;hysterical&quot; sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.<br/><br/>I&#39;m not big on gangster flicks because it&#39;s hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can&#39;t wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.<br/><br/>Highlights abound, starting with Brando&#39;s great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael&#39;s rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968&#39;s &quot;Bullitt&quot;); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent &quot;love at first sight&quot; moment in Sicily; Sonny&#39;s beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael&#39;s men carrying out their wicked deeds.<br/><br/>What&#39;s the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.<br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 2 hours &amp; 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola &amp; Mario Puzo from Puzo&#39;s book.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"

I think this one is the best of the three parts and it is a timeless classic.<br/><br/>I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.<br/><br/>It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question. How much of this could happen in the real life? I will leave you to wonder."
971,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Without doubt one of the most endearing stories to touch the human soul. Very rare a film succeeds in taking the mantle away from the novel. However this is one of those cases when it simply just does.<br/><br/>This soul finding, awe inspiring against all the odds film is a great adaptation of Stephen King&#39;s 1982 Novella entitled &#39;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&#39;.<br/><br/>This is the film that will make you think that there is hope in the world and that with great perseverance &#39;anything can be over come&#39;. Set in the times of what looks like the depression and located within the backdrop of the sleepy south of America.<br/><br/>A man sent to prison for life for a crime he did not commit, and how this alien world of the lower reaches of society seem at first that he will be broken and beaten and either die or go mad (as so many of the inmates succumb to). As Simon and Garfunkel had their books and poetry &#39;to protect them (me)&#39; so the lead character Andy Dufresne has his to protect him from such failings. In Rita Hayworth he has a passage of physical escape as opposed to the virtual world of books. He gains respect over time not through physical violence but by the craft of his mind and sheer willpower. Like a chess master he is thinking several moves ahead of everyone. Even the old master lag played by Morgan Freeman can only watch this man from a distance. However he relays through mainly past tense commentary how this man was as GB Shaw would say was &#39;Superman&#39;. Eventually like a great master he exposes the lies,hypocrisy and greed of the evil church going warden. This is not a film but a journey to the very survival of the human soul and as the lead character passes through leads a golden light on those condemned even if only for a passing moment in time. Like a bird on a journey he is destined to be free. Enjoy this film because it may if only for a moment save your soul."
3155,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of &quot;fluff&quot; that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;troubled&quot; in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment.<br/><br/>There were days when few great film makers were trying to make money to make their passion - the movie - come into existence, not the other way around. This movie is one of them, and its substance shows. If you watch this movie, you will be treated to the best directing and acting money can buy. A true Gem of a Holly Wood movie making."
2830,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It&#39;s a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named &quot;The Best Movie of All Time.&quot;"
4366,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Francis Ford Coppola has done some brilliant work, but he has never been better than in The Godfather and the sequel. This is a complex story set in New York City in the era just after World War II. It involves the Corleone Family, an Italian-American family that has thrived in the U.S. as the father of the clan (Vito Corleone/Marlon Brando) turned to organized crime to gain his slice of the American Pie. I won&#39;t get into the plot too much for fear of invoking the &quot;spoiler&quot; rule, but the essential plot revolves around a dispute between the Corleone Family and one of the other crime families over Corleone&#39;s unwillingness to engage in the illegal drug trade.<br/><br/>Although the movie is strictly Hollywood fantasy in its treatment of the American Mafia (it is NOT this glamorous), the Godfather does play on some real life plot twists in the history of the mafia. For example, Carlo Gambino, the head of the most powerful of New York&#39;s Five Families for decades, did in fact have a strong moral and practical opposition to the drug trade which led to his famous edict of &quot;deal and die&quot; for those under his command.<br/><br/>The plot is a modern version of a Shakespaerean or Greek tragedy as the family patriarch(s) rationalize their actions in the name of protecting the family. It&#39;s a classic plot line that has been around for centuries, but it has never been better than in the Godfather. The direction is fantastic and the acting is unreal. Brando as the father is flawless, and Al Pacino and James Caan are brilliant as the sons. Also, the supporting cast is also first rate. Look for great supporting roles from Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Sterling Hayden and a host of other talented actors.<br/><br/>Anyone who doesn&#39;t love this movie is either lying or just trying to cause trouble. 10 out 10 for sure."

Especially when he kicked Carlo&#39;s ass. Al Pacino also did a good job in it. I really liked him in this. It is my favorite role of his(this and Scarface).I believe Al Pacino should have won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. Francis Ford Copppla did a great job. He brought in great acting assemble for this movie. He pretty much started Al Pacino&#39;s amazing career. Everybody remembers James Cann for his role, and the same for Marlon Brando&#39;s role.

Let&#39;s not forget Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzzo who had a big role in this movie&#39;s success beside the actors performance. The movie shows almost every aspect of life switching from emotion to tragedy in a unique way , as the same with the characters witch is Michaels case , changing from a loving young man and uninterested of power to a man that is unflinching in his belief. That in one word : Breathtaking"

With a cast of Oscar winners and awesome script, this film feels like you have been implanted into the scene of a real environment. Life like acting with emotive vibrations, grips you from the offset, with a compelling story that seems to get more intense and exciting as the film rolls on. This film will never get old and I have the lost the count how many times I have watched the famous trilogy. Having owned this on Video, DVD and now Bluray, I can honestly say this will be in my collection for all time. True classic. <br/><br/>Peace and Blessings"
5412,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is a really wonderful film, I like it so much, after watching it, I feel that I have experienced the character&#39;s life, it gives me some thoughts, what life do I really like? And now, I will give review on this film from three aspects: plot, performance and direct. Firstly, the plot is logical and attractive, which tells a story full of violence and betrayal based on the gangster background. However, it is different from other films because it tells a warm and careful story at the same time. The film shows the power&#39;s influence on a person by describing the transaction of the main characterMichael. Secondly, all the actors contribute wonderful and excellent performance, they seem like they are just the characters who living in the film world all the time, all the acts match the characters perfectly. For me, I think the soul of a film is good actors, a great actor can deliver the inner of character to us, which can teach us some life thoughts and experience. Then, about the direct, this film also has a good direct way, as a classic film, its direct way is so wonderful, the film begins with the sentence:I believe America. In the next film, it tries to divert the opinion all the time. And in the film, there have two Montago, which attract me deeply. All in all, the film is a classic and wonderful film, and come back to my thinking, I think I prefer a easy and firm life, trying to accept my own life and control greed in the soul."

The whole thing felt pointless and empty, as if it had no story, no creativity. The characters were dull and uninteresting, with no real development or purpose.

It&#39;s also extremely overrated-people praise it faaaaaar more than it deserves, and I can&#39;t understand why. Just a complete waste of time that left me feeling frustrated and disappointed, totally not recommending it to anyone at all."

3422,tt0068646,The Godfather,"At the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando&#39;s unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles.<br/><br/>Coppola&#39;s direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the &quot;Prince of Darkness,&quot; enhances the film&#39;s iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota&#39;s haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend.<br/><br/>A fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history."

And then this movie ain&#39;t gonna be any different for you. It might have been revolutionary for its time because it brought a new storyline in the world of cinema, but now I have seen this exact narrative so many times, it&#39;s predictable for me. So for me, it was a 6/10. Actually it was somewhat disappointing because seeing a rating of 9.2 I was expecting my mind to be blown away. Sure the movie was not bad, but not good enough for a 9.2 rating? Seeing people rate this so high in 2020s seem weird to me."

2653,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo&#39;s The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.<br/><br/>The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It&#39;s the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn&#39;t (or, at least, shouldn&#39;t) pay.<br/><br/>It still doesn&#39;t, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren&#39;t limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.<br/><br/>Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo&#39;s point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.<br/><br/>For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative&#39;s point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.<br/><br/>Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks—&quot;they are animals anyway.&quot;<br/><br/>This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.<br/><br/>The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It&#39;s not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.<br/><br/>Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters&#39; Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.<br/><br/>The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life—marriages, baptisms, family feasts—become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It&#39;s nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.<br/><br/>THE GODFATHER (MOVIE)<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; written by Mario Puzo and Mr. Coppola, based on the novel by Mr. Puzo; director of photography, Gordon Willis; edited by William Reynolds, Peter Zinner, Marc Laub, and Murray Solomon; music by Nino Rota; production designer, Dean Tavoularis; produced by Albert S. Ruddy; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 175 minutes."
1452,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don&#39;t like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn&#39;t change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That&#39;s why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn&#39;t seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it&#39;s far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.<br/><br/>The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It&#39;s a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven&#39;t seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn&#39;t disappoint."
3599,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is simply the best gangster movie of all time and one of the greatest movies in cinema history from the very beginning every character is believable, every speech sounds authentic and every scene draws you deeper and deeper into the story.<br/><br/>The big name stars in this movie put in incredible performances. If you like movies put his on your must see list, if you like mobster movies buy it now."
4937,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Good script, Great casting,excellent acting,is very strong"
4637,tt0068646,The Godfather,"What makes this movie so good?  Just about everything.  Good acting, good direction, good story, good development...it&#39;s weird, but this is one of those cases where the sequel makes it better.  Godfather II is the best sequel ever made, and I just don&#39;t think you can really say anything about this movie until you&#39;ve seen that one.  Really, you have to look at the first one as the rise of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), and the second as his fall.  Despite the fact that he doesn&#39;t lose power, he loses almost everything else.  You don&#39;t really get much character development of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in this movie, because it&#39;s all being saved for the sequel (in the form of Robert De Niro).  The way that the two are intertwined is just absolutely brilliant. As a movie by itself, The Godfather is still a masterpiece.  One of the things that I think makes it so compelling is the blurring of the line between good and evil.  Just about everyone in this movie is a bad guy. But there are good bad guys and bad bad guys, and we&#39;re on the outside trying to decide which ones we want to root for.  We end up cheering on the Corleones, the focal point of the movie, but it&#39;s very reluctant as the climactic scene unfolds.  I found myself right there with Kay (Diane Keaton) at the end, torn between what I know to be right and what has to be done for survival. I cannot imagine this movie being any better.  It&#39;s fascinating, and the sequel does not do anything to diminish that sense of awe.  It&#39;s a timeless classic about the battle between good and evil.  But does evil really win out?  It&#39;s impossible to tell."
4832,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father&#39;s life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola&#39;s direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando&#39;s mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan&#39;s hot headed Santino to Robert Duval&#39;s purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael&#39;s transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn &quot;Godfather&quot;, is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed. Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/19122-the-godfather"
2120,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One of the most enjoyable movies ever, with deep an interesting charachters and realistic storylines. Quite toned down, no over the top action, but the gradual transformation of Michael into a mafia boss, despite his intent not to become one. An important scence in the beginning, from the wedding, has come to symbolize the type of relationship-based culture for me. Bonasera has been avioding the mob for a long time, but now that his daugther was assaulted, he needs their help. He comes and asks for help, offering money. The Godfather refuses - he does not want money, we wants respect. Debt precedes money as a social institution, according to Graeber. The original way of functioning in an economy was local and very trust-based. These types of institutions, together with a well-developed honor codex are very prevalent in the mafia culture. The gracious, private, inconspicuous nature of the mafia, and their honor of their word are central to their role in society.<br/><br/>The story touches on the American dream. I believe in America. America has made my fortune. Bonasera tells Don Vito who knows well enough that Bonasera earned his financial success through legal means, being a man of integrity and with faith in the American judicial system. Like a good American? who has assimilated in the American way of life, Bonasera raised his daughter in the American fashion and gave her freedom<br/><br/>onasera uses the American Dream and tries to live in it, relish in it, and bask in the glory of it. Once he encounters a pivotal moment in his life that threatens his ideals and his family and could not find clarity in the dark side of the Dream, he runs down to Don Vitoäs underworld."

278,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Out of the fertile mind of American author Steven King, comes the incredible prison story called &quot;The Shawshank Redemption.&quot; It is the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sent to the notorious Shawshank, Dufresne, is subjected to the standard abuses every prisoner faces. During the ensuing years however, he is further subjected to additional punishment by the &quot;Sisters&quot; who enjoy torturing what they call &#39;fresh fish.&#39; Still Andy tries to survive each day of his sentence as best he can. Being extremely agile at his banking craft, he overhears Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) complain of his personal financial problems. This single incident allows Andy to take advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again. Over the years, he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding who is adroitly played by veteran actor, Morgan Freeman. When warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) learns of Dufresnes&#39; financial ability, he immediately takes advantage of it. This arrangement presents many financial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and patience prisoner. Both can benefit from the outcome. The warden intends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to. Be he has he has more talent than the warden suspects. With additional characters actors like William Sadler as Heywood, Gil Bellows as Tommy, Mark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior performance as Brooks Hatlen, this film is destined as a classic for the enjoyment of every audience. ****"
4851,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The execution of the 5 family heads is one of the most powerful scenes not only in this trilogy, but of all film. You have Michael swearing to renounce Satan in the church while his minions are slaughtering men on the street, under his orders.<br/><br/>Here is Pacino as Michael who in his own right is just so downright haunting. He is a man who has literally damned himself, and is forever tortured. Seeing, his character go from the war hero marine to the haunted and isolated Mafia Don..... Wow.<br/><br/>Brando. Again. Wow. That scene with him and Duvall where, Don Vito is told by a broken-hearted Tom that Sonny has been killed, and Michael&#39;s involvement in the murders. Or that final exchange between Vito &amp; Michael. The dialogue is so un-forced, so natural, so real - gives me goosebumps! The most touching scene, for me, are the scenes between Michael and Apollonia, the local Sicilian girl who he falls in love with. And how couldn&#39;t he? &quot;Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday...&quot; She was so innocent.<br/><br/>All in all, my favorite scene I think is the scene in the Italian restaurant, leading up to Michael&#39;s murder of Sallozzo and McCluskey --Pacino&#39;s performance in that scene is just off the charts-- you can almost feel his mounting stress and blood pressure right through the screen."

1293,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"**Movie Review: The Shawshank Redemption**<br/><br/>*The Shawshank Redemption* (1994), directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King&#39;s novella *Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption*, is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time, continuously finding new audiences decades after its release. Its emotional depth, impeccable performances, and timeless themes of hope, friendship, and perseverance have cemented it as one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>Set in the 1940s and 1950s, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy&#39;s journey of survival, dignity, and quiet rebellion against an unjust system unfolds over the course of two decades. At the heart of this journey is Andy&#39;s friendship with Ellis Redding, or &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman), an inmate who has spent much of his life in Shawshank. Through their bond, the film explores themes of institutionalization, the corrosive effects of power, and the redemptive potential of human connection.<br/><br/>**Performances**<br/><br/>The film&#39;s success is largely owed to its outstanding performances. Tim Robbins delivers a nuanced portrayal of Andy Dufresne, a man who, despite being wrongfully imprisoned, maintains an air of quiet dignity and unshakeable belief in his own innocence. Robbins doesn&#39;t rely on overt emotional outbursts but rather expresses Andy&#39;s inner turmoil through subtle gestures and a calm demeanor, making his character&#39;s transformation from a man broken by injustice to one who finds hope in the most unlikely of places profoundly affecting.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, as Red, gives a career-defining performance. Red&#39;s voiceover narration throughout the film serves as a guide, offering the audience access to his internal thoughts and reflections. Freeman imbues Red with a wisdom that only comes from years of living within a system designed to strip away one&#39;s humanity. His portrayal is warm, grounded, and deeply empathetic, drawing the audience into the emotional heart of the story. It is through Red&#39;s eyes that the audience sees the slow unfolding of Andy&#39;s incredible journey, making their friendship the emotional core of the film.<br/><br/>**Direction and Cinematography**<br/><br/>Frank Darabont&#39;s direction is nothing short of masterful. He captures the harshness of Shawshank prison without ever indulging in melodrama, focusing instead on the characters and their emotional landscapes. The film&#39;s pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to fully absorb the passage of time and the transformation of the characters. Darabont&#39;s use of space within Shawshank creates a sense of isolation, with the imposing walls of the prison acting as a metaphor for the emotional imprisonment of its inhabitants. Yet, the film also makes use of its natural surroundings-such as the scenes set by the beach in the final act-to emphasize the sense of liberation that is so central to the story.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Roger Deakins is stunning, capturing the bleakness of Shawshank and the occasional beauty found within it. The contrast between the dark, oppressive interior of the prison and the occasional bursts of light and nature outside reinforces the themes of hope and freedom. The most iconic visual moment is the image of Andy standing with his arms spread wide against a downpour of rain-a symbolic moment of release and renewal. This frame has become one of the most recognizable in cinematic history, representing the film&#39;s central message: even in the darkest of circumstances, there is always hope.<br/><br/>**Themes and Symbolism**<br/><br/>At its core, *The Shawshank Redemption* is a story about hope. Andy&#39;s journey is a testament to the human spirit&#39;s ability to endure even the most harrowing conditions. While Shawshank is a place where men are broken, Andy refuses to let the system strip away his sense of self. Through his intelligence, resilience, and quiet rebellion, he retains a sense of agency. His ability to maintain hope, even when it seems utterly hopeless, makes him a symbol of inner strength.<br/><br/>In contrast, Red represents the danger of losing hope. Having spent decades in prison, Red initially believes that life outside Shawshank is impossible for men like him. His eventual rediscovery of hope, spurred by Andy&#39;s friendship, is one of the film&#39;s most powerful moments. Red&#39;s eventual release from Shawshank is not just a physical one, but an emotional and spiritual one as well.<br/><br/>The film also explores the theme of institutionalization-the idea that the prison system, instead of rehabilitating individuals, often dehumanizes and destroys them. The character of Brooks (James Whitmore), an elderly inmate who struggles to adjust to life outside Shawshank, embodies this theme. Brooks&#39; inability to cope with freedom after decades of imprisonment underscores the damaging effect of a system that strips men of their agency and humanity.<br/><br/>Moreover, the film is rich with symbolic elements. The most prominent of these is the role of books and education in the lives of the prisoners. Andy uses his skills to improve the lives of those around him, including creating a library and tutoring inmates. This is not just an escape from the prison&#39;s physical walls, but an act of rebellion against the intellectual confinement the institution tries to impose on them.<br/><br/>**Legacy and Impact**<br/><br/>Despite a lukewarm reception at the box office upon its release, *The Shawshank Redemption* has since become a beloved classic. It has consistently ranked as one of the greatest films of all time in numerous polls, including being #1 on IMDb&#39;s Top 250 list. Its themes resonate deeply with audiences worldwide, and it has found a lasting place in pop culture.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s exploration of the human capacity for resilience, redemption, and the power of friendship speaks universally, transcending its setting and characters. *The Shawshank Redemption* reminds us that even in the most oppressive circumstances, the human spirit can endure, and in the end, freedom is not just a physical state, but a mental and emotional one.<br/><br/>**Conclusion**<br/><br/>In summary, *The Shawshank Redemption* is a film that speaks to the heart of what it means to be human. With its incredible performances, masterful direction, and exploration of hope, freedom, and friendship, it remains one of the most enduring cinematic experiences. It&#39;s a film that celebrates the triumph of the human spirit and reminds us that, no matter how dire the situation may seem, redemption is always within reach."

It&#39;s not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.<br/><br/>Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters&#39; Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.<br/><br/>The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life—marriages, baptisms, family feasts—become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It&#39;s nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.<br/><br/>THE GODFATHER (MOVIE)<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; written by Mario Puzo and Mr. Coppola, based on the novel by Mr. Puzo; director of photography, Gordon Willis; edited by William Reynolds, Peter Zinner, Marc Laub, and Murray Solomon; music by Nino Rota; production designer, Dean Tavoularis; produced by Albert S. Ruddy; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 175 minutes."
1467,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Michael Corleone returns home from the war for his sister&#39;s wedding. However his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main families sparked by the marketing of drugs.  Michael&#39;s involvement in the family business increases when his father is the victim of an assassination attempt and Michael wants to kill the two men responsible before going to Italy for a year to lay low.  When Michael&#39;s brother Sonny is murdered, Michael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the war.<br/><br/>The most famous and the best film about organised crime is also one of the best films ever made.  The plot is at once straightforward and complex, it deals with things on many levels from the action to the theme of family. The basic story is gripping and sprawling at the same time.  It creates many memorable scenes and lines that have become part of the general knowledge that we all share  that&#39;s why it&#39;s referred to in everything from Sopranos down to The Simpsons.<br/><br/>Every shot is perfectly framed and has a great sense of period throughout. From the opening speech with it&#39;s memorable lines and camera focus down to the final shot and all it implies, it is full throughout.  The action is a pleasure to watch and the lines are so much more classy than more recent attempts at gangster films.<br/><br/>Pacino is great  he not only changes before our eyes over the 3 hours but he manages it into the next film too.  Brando is always a risk on any film, and when he started mumbling and filling his cheeks with cotton wool, Coppola must have worried about what was happening, but he delivers a performance that is so good that almost everyone has impersonated him at some time.  The main cast is full of good performances from actors from all stages.  Up and comers such as Duvall, Caan, Keaton etc are as good as more ageing icons such as Richard Conte, Sterling Haydn, Castellano etc.<br/><br/>In every area the film oozes class and professionalism.  The look at family life is excellent and the only downside is that it can&#39;t help but glamorise organised crime  people may be killed but it still looks and sounds cool. But then, if we&#39;re going to start criticising films because they glamorise violence or destruction then The Godfather comes along way down the hit list  long after countless hundreds of action movies and summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>Overall this film will always be a classic, your Harry Potters, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc will come and go based on how well hyped they are  but Godfather has been on most people&#39;s top 5 list for decades and will to continue to be for many more.  Now that&#39;s respect."

Well,the story of this movie is too good to be true.<br/><br/>The Shawshank redemption is based on the book by Stephen King and certainly this is the most brilliant adaptation which has ever based from the writer&#39;novels. The playtime is rather long but seems to be not boring.It&#39;s excellently produced,and the acting(Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman)is marvellous.The script is clever enough about the human&#39;s relationships and the escape from the prison.The characters and the story itself are clearly true."

So-I am going to admit it straight out here-I have NEVER-I repeat-NEVER been able to get into the godfather-I feel almost guilty saying it-but it is the truth-This is considered to be the best of the best. But I didn&#39;t feel any of the fascination that many others did.<br/><br/>I have tried(unsuccessfully) to watch this from start to finish and it never works-ever. I always turn it off. I want to like this because of how amazing it is supposed to be. I have family members that watch it over and over and over again. But not I. I just-it just did not compute. Ever.<br/><br/>I suppose there are those films considered masterpieces that for some reason or other one just can&#39;t like. That is how this is for me. I could not appreciate the dialogue, very slow pace, I never got into the character studies, to much violence and I would always get an odd restless feeling. But I guess everyone has a movie or two like that where they just don&#39;t get it. This is mine.<br/><br/>I really really wanted to like this film. If I ever do, I&#39;ll come back on and post an apology."

732,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies I have ever seen. The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. Unlike most of his novels King didn&#39;t write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home run with this movie.<br/><br/>Not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. The directing, cast, and plot all combine to make the movie awesome.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. The story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life.<br/><br/>Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope. Ultimately Andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. The message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history.<br/><br/>Overall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time."

Movie Review
On the whole, The Godfather is an extremly impressive thriller, narrated in a sensible manner. One of the best movies I have ever reviewed. Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &quot;The Godfather,&quot; is a masterpiece. Stairs, When Marlon Brando put weights under his body on the bed scene, as a prank, to make it harder to lift him, it was brilliant.<br/><br/>During Sonny and Carlo&#39;s fight, one of Sonny&#39;s &quot;movie&quot; punches is shot from the wrong angle and clearly misses, but still produces the sound of an impact, was another brilliant move. When Rocco killed Paulie in the car was a truly amazing scene. Then when Peter Clemenza: states Leave the gun. Take the cannoli, truly shows what&#39;s most important.<br/><br/>Also In the end credits, Marlon Brando&#39;s name is the only one that is not accompanied by the character name that he plays ie: Marlon Brando &quot;as Vito Corleone&quot;."
3327,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Due to the restrictions of the 10 point voting system I have been forced to settle on a 9/10 rating, however I prefer a more accurate score, and that would be 8.9 stars.<br/><br/>The movie is an undoubtable classic. I&#39;ve noticed on here there are a lot of 1 star reviews, all of which are rather ignorant and at times rather obnoxious. It&#39;s understandable if it doesn&#39;t live up to your expectations, but I don&#39;t even think this movie should have the option of a star rating below 5 because anyone who gives it lower rating should not really be reviewing movies. I admit that I was very against the idea of this film, the idea that it was so popular but would really live up to the standards set by so many sycophantic fans seemed almost impossible to me. Having already been disappointed by the movie &quot;Avatar&quot; (not visually of course, but for the predictable and, at times, tiresome plot). The Godfather, on the other hand, has a much more unpredictable storyline, yet nothing that happens is a huge shock. At times seemingly arbitrary events eventually collate into a cohesive part of the movie. Despite pushing the 3 hour mark, you are constantly entertained, and hanging on to every word, almost every action holds some importance and the feeling that something is about to happen is constant and justified.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t want to reveal too much about the movie so I shall attempt to keep the review vague in places, and will stop in regards to the storyline now. <br/><br/>Even if the storyline fails to inspire, at the very least, some sort of appreciation, there are five words that command respect: &quot;Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.&quot; They give the film a level of cool, control and power that affects the viewer in many ways, and maybe even re-establishes the idea of acting. Powerful emotions, casually being used with an air on nonchalance and grace, emotions that are usually over-played, and over-acted in other movies in which actors flaunt their talents carelessly. In this film we get a masterclass in acting from two masters of the screen. The acting from every character is pitched perfectly, every character balances each other out, and their personalities are contrastingly complimentary towards each other. <br/><br/>I have a lot of good to say about this movie, so now I should explain why i gave it a &quot;mere&quot; 8.9. Firstly I must admit I don&#39;t believe in the idea that there is such thing as a &quot;perfect&quot; movie, so I am viewed as a somewhat &quot;harsh marker,&quot; and thus it would never get a full 10.0, but there are some aspects of this film that I believe to be either superfluous or under-developed. Basically put, there are bits that could maybe be replaced by some extra character or storyline developments. This, however, is just a personal issue, and I would stress that 8.9 is the second highest rating I have ever given, and to be honest, my mind is constantly changing on that score, and I may actually, in the future, wish to raise it. <br/><br/>On a final note, I will just say that this truly is one of the greatest films ever made, and I would urge anyone reading this to watch the film. If you don&#39;t like it that is a shame, but if you do (which you probably will), it will be a film you will carry with you for the rest of your life."
4791,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; is by far the most loved and cherished Movie in cinema history, You just can&#39;t escape it, but that might be the problem.<br/><br/>Since everybody that has access to the internet have read that sentence or one like it (The Godfather is the best movie ever), It feels like everybody loves it because they&#39;re told to, Everybody says they love the godfather and that it&#39;s the best movie ever made, but are they just following the crowd?<br/><br/>When&#39;s the last time you heard someone say the godfather is one of their favorite movies ever? Probably not long ago, when&#39;s the last time you heard somebody actually tell you what&#39;s so good about it without repeating those same words (Acting, Influential, Classic)?<br/><br/>Of course there ARE people who actually explain everything that is great about it and deep dive into analyzing the subtle things it inhabits, but would they have done it if they haven&#39;t constantly heard that it&#39;s the greatest movie ever?<br/><br/>Ok, you can stop screaming at your screen, &quot;The Godfather Is Terrible! It&#39;s so overrated!&quot; and so on, you don&#39;t like it, or are you just following a trend?<br/><br/>Look at the ratings of the godfather on any reviewing site (IMDB, Letterboxd etc.) and you&#39;ll see that 5/10 stars as the most popular rating and then the numbers of all the other ratings quickly go down, until a random spike at the bottom (1/2 star/1 star), that&#39;s because it&#39;s become a trend to hate the godfather.<br/><br/>People have 2 reactions to hearing that the godfather is the best movie ever made: 1, I know, It&#39;s a masterpiece, so amazing, it&#39;s a classic. (And they just didn&#39;t watch it or didn&#39;t pay attention) or: 2, No it&#39;s not! It sucks! It&#39;s overrated! Worst movie ever! (And they probably didn&#39;t watch it either)<br/><br/>My point is, you can&#39;t find a single review of &quot;The Godfather&quot; which hasn&#39;t been HEAVILY influenced by the general stigma of this movie, it&#39;s either they followed all the others like zombies, or they think they&#39;re revolutionaries by saying they don&#39;t. Nobody thinks the Godfather is a 1 star/ half a star movie, they just don&#39;t.<br/><br/>This movie IS amazing, but nobody seems to actually think so."

I have introduced The Godfather trilogy to my two sons with 9 and 7 yrs old 8 years ago. in the beginning, they understood nothing but captured the main message: The father is a wise and respectable man.
Nowadays, every time this movie is broadcasting at cable TVs or movie portals, both stopped what they are doing to watch saying the Marlon Brando scripts.
My legacy was passed to them by these 3 movies.

229,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"A film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont.  .  .  Who?  Starring Tim Robbins.  .  .  Wasn&#39;t he the guy from Howard the Duck?  I admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie.  Now the only questions I have to ask are:  Why didn&#39;t EVERYBODY go to see this movie?  and, Why didn&#39;t Morgan Freeman win the Oscar?  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan.  Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus&#39;.  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow.  Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach.  .  .  Perfect."
4374,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It&#39;s ability to transcend the test of time, and it&#39;s perfect cinematic portrayal of an infamous subculture are what make this movie so highly regarded. The movie was so captivating and did such a good job of identifying the Italian American Organized Crime Sub-Culture that it actually became the handbook by which future generations of mobsters operated. I can&#39;t think of many movies that have had that kind of cultural impact. Brilliant production from start to finish! The show was cast perfectly helping to solidify it as a classic. Even today the movie is relevant and has provided a basis and format for movies about organized crime. Intensity of the scenes was key to the accurate portrayal of the life of a crime family."
2621,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The first words in Francis Coppola&#39;s organized crime saga (&quot;I believe in America&quot;) are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant&#39;s passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It&#39;s an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas."
5580,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Review of &quot;The Godfather&quot;<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &quot;The Godfather,&quot; released in 1972, is a cinematic masterpiece that has secured its place as one of the greatest films ever made. Based on Mario Puzo&#39;s novel of the same name, this epic crime drama captivates audiences with its powerful storytelling, memorable characters, and profound exploration of power, family, and morality within the Mafia underworld of 1940s and 50s America.<br/><br/>At the heart of &quot;The Godfather&quot; is the Corleone crime family, led by the iconic Don Vito Corleone, played flawlessly by Marlon Brando. Brando&#39;s portrayal of the aging patriarch is nothing short of legendary, capturing both the ruthless determination and tender familial love that define the character. His raspy voice and imposing presence command every scene he is in, making Don Vito a figure of both fear and admiration.<br/><br/>Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, the youngest son who initially wants nothing to do with his family&#39;s criminal enterprises. Pacino&#39;s transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader is portrayed with subtle intensity, showcasing his character&#39;s moral descent as he becomes increasingly embroiled in the world of organized crime.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is equally exceptional, with James Caan as the hotheaded Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as the pragmatic Tom Hagen, and Diane Keaton as Michael&#39;s innocent wife, Kay Adams. Each actor brings depth and complexity to their roles, adding layers to the intricate web of relationships and betrayals that drive the narrative forward.<br/><br/>Coppola&#39;s direction is masterful, employing a deliberate pace that allows the characters and their motivations to unfold naturally. The film&#39;s cinematography, by Gordon Willis, is striking, using shadow and light to heighten the drama and emphasize the moral ambiguity of the characters&#39; actions. The score, composed by Nino Rota, is hauntingly beautiful, underscoring the film&#39;s emotional weight and dramatic tension."

1730,tt0068646,The Godfather,It&#39;s one of those movies that I watch over and over again over the years. It is a masterpiece that even the new generation prefers to watch. Marlon Brando Al Pacino James Caan Performances are amazing.
4429,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is one of my favorite movies. However, the last time I saw it, I was disappointed to spot a serious flaw in the plot that I never realized before. It seems that not many people have. The movie is still so great, that this blunder is forgivable. But, at least for me, it will never be the same again. If you read any further, you may be as disappointed as I was.<br/><br/>When Michael decides to try and kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, he assumes that the three will be alone in a restaurant without further protection from the Sollozzo family, so Michael will be able to walk away after shooting them down. This assumption is completely unfounded; for all the Corleones know, the place could have been packed with Sollozzo men. The whole plan revolves around the idea that they will be able to find out the place of the meeting in advance, which was to be unilaterally chosen by the enemy. Well, in the event, the Corleones do find the name of the restaurant. They still assume their victims will have no protection, and now they know where the three will be. What could be easier than sending a couple of men there to do the deed, instead of planting the gun for the inexperienced Michael, which is patently a riskier approach? No group of thugs would have overlooked this. In the movie, the option is not even mentioned."
1535,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.<br/><br/>A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you&#39;re never bored. It&#39;s wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It&#39;s also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (&quot;I&#39;ll make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot;) have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she&#39;s married into. The look on her face is perfect.<br/><br/>This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing."
3892,tt0068646,The Godfather,"For years I&#39;ve been hearing great things about this &quot;epic&quot; film, The Godfather. It&#39;s been aired on television numerous times, but I really didn&#39;t feel like sitting through a 5 hour run time (with added commercials). So I finally decided I should watch this film and get it over with, so through my local library I checked out The Godfather.<br/><br/>The film was very disappointing through the first watch, though the length of the film didn&#39;t bother me, I couldn&#39;t understand half of what Marlon Brando was saying. I was ready to rate The Godfather 5 stars when I came across a review from someone with similar feelings that said they watched the film again with subtitles. So I thought why not try to watch this disappointing film again with subtitles. What a difference!<br/><br/>The second watching with subtitles completely change my experience of The Godfather. I was able to understand the story a lot better and I&#39;m glad I gave the film a second chance. It&#39;s 9 stars for me!"

To be honest i don&#39;t even really think it should be in the top 250. Yeah, I know you Americans love the happy-ending Vaseline-flavored subtly homosexual jail movies, but all this hype it&#39;s too much anyway. Come on, this can&#39;t be better than Welles, Kubrick, Kurosawa or Scorsese (or not even Carpenter and Fulci in my humble opinion) So I give it a 1/10. This is not a critical valuation of the movie. This is a political statement."

All the characters are so well portrayed that you feel anger, happiness and sadness about them. The simplicity of the scenes and all the little things that makes them special is priceless. The music is great. It succeeds in showing the sadness of society, the evil greedy mind of people, the good hart of other and the happiness of living free. It also portays that hope can drive us really far, even if we are prisoners. Even if this movie is not my number one, it surely deserves the number one spot on IMDb."

It is not as bloody as this movie but it has a good plot. Godfather has a good plot but for me, it is just too much to handle. The movie would probably get away without so much blood but I guess you have to be realistic. I probably wouldn&#39;t watch this movie if I didn&#39;t take humanities, which is one of the requirements for my associates degree.

If you haven&#39;t seen it you&#39;re a missing out. It defines the term classic. It is timeless and everlastingly relevant. We&#39;ll still be watching this film in six hundred years.

It&#39;s like stepping onto a grand stage where every note must be pitch-perfect.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this burden can sometimes overshadow the experience. We anticipate fireworks at every turn, but instead, we get quiet conversations in dimly lit rooms. The film&#39;s brilliance lies in these subtleties, but they may not satisfy everyone.<br/><br/><ul><li>Performances and Atmosphere:</li></ul>Marlon Brando&#39;s portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is iconic. His wheezy voice and deliberate movements convey a lifetime of power and cunning. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone brings depth to his transformation from reluctant heir to ruthless strategist.<br/><br/>The tension hangs thick in the air-the smell of cigars, the dimly lit offices, and the hushed conversations-all contribute to an atmosphere that envelops us.<br/><br/>Yet, this deliberate approach can alienate viewers seeking instant gratification.<br/><br/><ul><li>Sociopathic Barbarism Disguised as &quot;Honest Business&quot;:</li></ul>&quot;The Godfather&quot; strips away the glitz and glamour associated with mobster films. Instead, it reveals the raw underbelly-the power struggles, betrayals, and blood-soaked loyalties.<br/><br/>The mafia isn&#39;t romanticized; it&#39;s portrayed as a ruthless business where family bonds are both strength and vulnerability.<br/><br/>Over all, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is like a fine wine-one that requires patience to savor fully. If you&#39;re willing to embrace its measured pace and peer beyond the surface glamour, you&#39;ll find a masterpiece that transcends mere entertainment.<br/><br/>Note: While some may find it slow-paced, others consider it a methodical masterpiece. 🎥🍷"
1048,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Cannot see why this film is rated so highly.  Sure, its watchable and nicely inoffensive, but its not really about much, and nothing really happens. Just a film about a bloke going to prison.  Somewhere along the line I think I must have missed something, because I can think of at least a hundred better films.  Saying that, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are flawless, though the latter&#39;s best film will always be the Hudsucker Proxy.  (Which incidentally is a better film.)"
292,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This is just a typical prison yarn with some mawkish sentiment<br/><br/>tossed in. I really don&#39; t understand the fuss. I guess some people<br/><br/>look for grandeur and prjoect it onto middling, palatable material<br/><br/>like this. That&#39;s the only explanation I&#39;ve got for the unwarranted<br/><br/>popularity of this flick. Production credits are fine enough, as is the<br/><br/>acting but it certainly doesn&#39;t belong on any repsectable list of<br/><br/>greatest films of all time."
1168,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"There is life &amp; humor in it, and warmth in the friendship. There is even excitement &amp; suspense, although not when we expect it. Mostly Its about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. Its perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe thats part of the idea to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."

2218,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Because this movie has Extraordinary performances, amazing direction, incredible screenplay, and an excellent soundtrack, it&#39;s more than good, more than great, it&#39;s perfection in every way. When I first saw this movie, I was 10 years old, and I couldn&#39;t stand it, and now I love it, so be patient, watch this movie and observe every detail, that will make it unforgettable.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone(Brando) is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael(Pacino) has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Tania Shire, Michael&#39;s sister) to Carlo Rizzi(Russo). All of Michael&#39;s family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo(Lettieri) is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don&#39;s lawyer Tom Hagen(Duvall), the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.<br/><br/>Everybody says that the movie gets everything right, and it&#39;s true. This movie follows a narrative rhythm that is impeccable, it never slows down too much, and that&#39;s because the whole movie is slow. And in some tense scenes (Like the scene where Michael is changing his father&#39;s room in the hospital), and even some funny ones (When Michael is in Sicily talking to a man about that girl that he met, and the guy finds out that she&#39;s his daughter), it&#39;s done with excellency.<br/><br/>The screenplay is one of the best ever made. It develops it&#39;s character so well, that almost everyone is learning something during the story. And of course, it gives us memorable quotes like the classic &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse!&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m a superstitious man!&quot;. The Soundtrack by Nino Rota is brilliant, and you can notice that right in the first scene.<br/><br/>The acting is equally impressing, even Pacino that don&#39;t usually blows my mind like everyone says (Not that he is a bad actor, he&#39;s excellent, but I prefer contained and calm performances), impressed me a lot, he&#39;s so cold and looks so smart that make his turns believable and intelligent. Brando gives one the best performances the world has ever seen, and considering that he was 48 when this movie was released, he convinced me that he was a sick, old man (Which Pacino didn&#39;t do that well in &quot;The Godfather: Part III&quot;). And observe the scene where Hagen tells him about Sonny, and you&#39;ll see what I mean by saying that it&#39;s one of the best of all time.<br/><br/>Verdict: A lot of people, including me, say that it&#39;s the best movie ever made, so they probably have a good reason to say that."
504,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This film is a modern classic. Why? Because it simply includes everything which builds a great story, and that is all films really are, storytelling.<br/><br/>The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in an industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and employing world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy option, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never be remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves into people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.<br/><br/>This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it. You are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when Andy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in one of the best lead parts in a film ever. He is simply superb. Plus, Morgan Freeman, well, would we expect anything less from a man with such talent?<br/><br/>It is this relationship, between Andy(Robbins) and Red(Freeman) which really strikes me as a breathe of fresh air, as if i had been hit in the face by a strong wind. We are trapped in a society where relationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people involved are having sex. Hollywood have molded this preconception that characters with a relationship must sleep together. Shawshank, for once, tells the tale of two men, who by the end of the film have a very strong relationship, but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road of madness. Their friendship is portrayed free of sex, yet is portrayed so powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending. Personally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful.<br/><br/>The plot is also perfectly timed. I am someone that is usually quite critical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on. Shawshank gives you a mixture of paces, but also keeps the story turning and turning, as if it has a heart beat, pumping more and more of the story line, unwinding the plot before your open jaw.<br/><br/>Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing. Again, i am normally quite critical of films that have swearing in, just to look cool, or higher the rating. Swearing in that context seems unnatural, and therefore disjointed. However the swearing in Shawshank seemed totally natural, and all part of the atmosphere of the prison.<br/><br/>Finally, i think everyone should see this film. This is a pure, yet thrilling tale of hope, friendship and belief. The story is executed brilliantly, with intense characteriztion from both sides of the spectrum- you become Andy, and go through his struggles with him, and you hate the warden and his captain with a passion.<br/><br/>I guarantee, by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen, you jaw will be open, your mind will be blown, and your heart will be broken into pieces. This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece."

I&#39;ve seen it so many times and I&#39;m such a movie buff that I&#39;ve made it my life&#39;s goal to actually FIND a flaw with the film, but I always come up empty. I&#39;ve heard the runtime criticized, but there are no superfluous parts to the movie that deserve cutting. I can only hope that we someday see a film that measures up, but won&#39;t hold my breath.

5000,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I heard about &quot;The Godfather&quot; a long time ago. But the reason I watched it for the first time is because of my English conversation class. My teacher is crazy about it. He asked us to write a movie thesis.
The story itself is very exciting.
But as a movie, to turn this story into a legend, you need a team of extraordinary play.
Marlon Brando, as a veteran actor, blended the two roles of father and godfather very well, and very natural. His first appearance in the movie has completely conquered the audience. He is a unique godfather.
Director: Francis Ford Coppola also arranged the story very well. Although this is a very long movie, I have no fatigue at all. The climax and calm of the story have very good rhythm and regularity.
Music is also iconic. You may forget it briefly, but when you hear it again, you will immediately know it is &quot;The Godfather&quot;."
277,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The &#39;Shawshank Redemption&#39; undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word &#39;Hope&#39; brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.<br/><br/>Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he influences his fellow prisoner &#39;Red&#39;. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of &#39;Red&#39; is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King, is equally good at any other genre of &#39;Story Writing&#39;(Hats off). The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. The background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectively.<br/><br/>Didn&#39;t watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible. Can&#39;t miss a movie like this...."

Don&#39;t miss them because you may never come across them in your life so beautifully. This movie goes into my favorite movies list which only had 2 movies so far(in 22 years) excluding this one.

Avoided watching it all these years because I knew there would be a lot of unimaginable brutality. Finally gave in yesterday. The depth of each character portrayed so fully how their role affected the rest. The magnificence of Andy&#39;s not just surviving 19 years in that mess, knowing his innocence.

Marlon Brando is a disgusting fat slob of a mafia boss - his offer you cant refuse scene is so laughably bad. All the rest of the cast looks like something out of a bad B movie with tough guy talk and slapping women around to be macho. James Caan is simply awful - he always trys hamming it up in every movie hes in as does Al Pacino. The movie itself is a disjointed mess with nothing but boring chatter and hearsay scenes in-between shooting people up or beating people up. Sure the mafia was bad and terrorized people but this movie just basically makes it look like a pay us for protection racket type thug movie. Overrrated,badly acted and boring.

4723,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Well what is there to say about this movie?  Is it still the top movie on this site, or is it not?  Personally, it is not one of the reviewer&#39;s all time favorites, but it is still a very good movie.  One significant  detail of this movie, is counter culture.  The movie is filled with it.<br/><br/>As the movie starts Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who is known as the Godfather, is in his office. It is his daughters wedding day, and according to  Sicilian tradition, he cannot refuse any requests that are made to him that day. The room is filled with people wanting something. The whole family is there for the occasion.  Michael (Al Pacino), the God father&#39;s youngest son , is back home from the war. He brings his new girl friend,   (Diane Keaton)  with him. Michael&#39;s brothers,  Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there too.<br/><br/>Family loyalty is an important message that is stressed in this movie. The Don, Vito Corleone heads the family . He is against dealing in drugs. According to him,  society is not alarmed by liquor, gambling or prostitution, but he feels it is wrong to deal drugs. He refers to it as a dirty business. What appears to be a moral decision on the Don&#39;s part is really counter culture because his decision not to support dealing in drugs has nothing to do with the legality of it but because he feels society would not accept it.  <br/><br/> A lot of emphasis is put on trusting a man&#39;s word, yet the central character do not always trust each other.  Woman are not highly regarded by the family. The Don&#39;s wife is only shown in a few scenes. Sonny ignores his wife. and the Don&#39;s daughter Connie&#39;s husband is not allowed into the family business. Instead, he given a job so he can earn a living.  The counter culture in this movie, represents the killings of innocent, and not so innocent people between families.  Throughout most of the movie, the Corleone family is in somewhat of a battle between another Italian family. Because of this, Don Corleone who is the Godfather of many, (Marlon Brando) is shot by one of the other families.  This heats up the subject for the Corleone family, because it puts two of his sons Michael (Al Pacino) and Santino `Sonny&#39; (James Caan) in between a rock and a hard place.  That is just one of the examples of counter culture in this movie.  Here is another example.  Sunny finds out two different times that his sister&#39;s husband is beating her.  Outraged by all this happening, Sunny takes off to go find his brother in law.  The first time, he finds him, he is successful in beating the wind out of him, however the second time he gets gunned down by his in-laws.   Right about then, Don, is called to make a peace treaty with the other family, to stop all this violence between the families.  But are all the violent scenes in the movie over with? Unfortunately not. There are so many more examples of counter culture than the ones listed in this review. In order to see all the examples of counter culture, you would have to view the movie a couple times to understand what is going on in it.<br/><br/>Over all, it was a very good movie in my opinion.  I was Glued to the edge of my seat the whole time, just waiting to see what happens next.  The reviewer gives The Godfather a five gold star rating."

2779,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In one portion of the movie michael corleone, the son of the godfather travels to Sicily with body guards because he&#39;s vulnerable to being victim of other mafia families. He becomes engaged with a woman there where they&#39;re together for a considerable period. During that time, his wife becomes the victim of a bomb blast planted in his vehicle via a spy who posed as a bodyguard.<br/><br/>When that happens do you think he<br/><br/>--&gt; A. Mourns her loss<br/><br/>--&gt; B. Barely touches upon it for the remainder of the movie<br/><br/>If you chose B, that is correct. It&#39;s inherent that the movie does show character development in some cases. But it shies away from making characters feel emotionally vulnerable. Take this example for instance, where Michael has to leave Sicily and return back to NY because of this. Although Michael talks about how he misses his wife in a scene or two, the mourning is never shown in depth. When he&#39;s back in NY, does he shed even a single tear? Does he self reflect on the events that happened? Does he learn and apply new perspectives from his deceased wife? And does his wife even show him new perspectives and values? No, no, no and from its lack of exposition, no. Everything he does after that is simply in vain. He learns absolutely nothing from her, and it is like her existence in the plot is a good 20-30 minutes of screen time gobbled up in front of the viewer&#39;s face. And it&#39;s inexcusable for a movie nearing 3 hours to have difficulty with exposition. What the movie has in plot, severely lacks in character development and emotional nuance. I feel that in this instance, you could say, &quot;Michael couldn&#39;t have mourned the loss of his wife because that would make him weak, and unfit for his line of work.&quot; But I completely disagree. If the movie isn&#39;t going to give the viewer that sense of vulnerability in characters, especially for the line of work they perform, you aren&#39;t going to give the viewer a sense of who they are, besides, &quot;a person who&#39;s born into thuggery. A man who&#39;s constantly angry and manipulative&quot; It makes for a very emotionally superficial watch, and was probably the main reason I had trouble finishing the whole movie. The depravity of each situation outweighs the reason or morality and it shows. It&#39;s arguable that the movie glorifies these actions, but that&#39;s a whole other argument to be discussed."

Instead of talking about its obvious care with excellent writing, directing, editing and cinematography, I&#39;ll just say how much the film has meant to me personally. Its message of hope and, above all, perseverance, kept me going through many of life&#39;s travails. I think I responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life (albeit in dramatic fashion)and even the stress of boredom. The other thing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another without even saying much to them. After all, Andy and Red only have one true baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together (One of the greatest scenes in the history of movies, by the way). Yet we are fully aware of how much these two meant to each other and how moved we are when they are reunited. It&#39;s a real spiritual journey (visually as well); almost like Red has died at the end (leaving Hell/Shawshank) and is reborn in Zihuatanejo (Heaven)to be rejoined with the one person who understands him. Just a marvelous, life-changing experience for me. My thanks to all who&#39;ve supported and created this movie.

The Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks originality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold. Portraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of  the story. In short, its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by American Film Institute. Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best. Pity. 7,5/10"
2681,tt0068646,The Godfather,"When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film &quot;a long, boring piece of crap.&quot; Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality. <br/><br/>Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn&#39;t show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn&#39;t believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, &quot;never take sides against the family.&quot; That is when crazy things begin to happen.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film<br/><br/>This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn&#39;t want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino&#39;s illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.<br/><br/>The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike&#39;s sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband&#39;s Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn&#39;t think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.<br/><br/>Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It&#39;s a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It&#39;s one of my favorite all-time scores.<br/><br/>Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America&#39;s most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven&#39;t seen the film, you should see it. It&#39;s almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"
4824,tt0068646,The Godfather,"We Totally Concur with what a Similar Film Critic (The Legendary Rybecca Quinn of TCW) competently wrote elsewhere (as follows) :<br/><br/>&quot; This Film (i.e The GodFather) is so (damn) good because it is a masterpiece of a film that is held together firmly through a strong cast, world-changing cinematography, and the music that intensifies the strong theme presented in the film.<br/><br/>This film is considered to be the best of Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s work, as well as many members of the cast.<br/><br/>The Godfather has become such an iconic film that nearly everyone knows at least one line or another from the film.&quot;<br/><br/>What more can we possibly add to that (except) that :<br/><br/>* It is Absolutely Excellent and Totally Fantabulous !<br/><br/>* It is Totally Excellent and Absolutely Fantabulous !<br/><br/>* It is One of the (Very) Best (Movie) Films (Ever) - in History !"
864,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Nice movie :-)
The story is about escaping from jail"
4122,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is a movie for people who want to watch fat guys eat pasta.<br/><br/>&quot;The Godfather&quot; confuses sentiment with emotion and nostalgia with authenticity. Like &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, it tries to capture something deep and meaningful about loyalty, family, and honor, but in the end manages only to convey that food plays an important role in Italian culture. <br/><br/>Brando&#39;s portrayal of Corleone becomes farcical as his brooding look tips over into a vacant stare.<br/><br/>In all fairness this is not an altogether bad movie, but it pales in comparison to the novel by Mario Puzo and deserves to be taken down a notch.<br/><br/>Watch this for the costumes."
4481,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The sequel of this movie is the American masterpiece, not this one<br/><br/>And it&#39;s so obvious if you watch the sequel and see how much has gone into it and the fact that it still stands up better than the original.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is a much better actor than Brando and proves it in this film. Al Pacino is at the top of his game also in this film, so this all adds up to this being the Godfather of American film making.<br/><br/>No competition, Godfather II is the best, the &#39;Elephant Man&#39; being a close second and &#39;The Butcher Boy&#39; finishing off my selection.<br/><br/>Who else loves &#39;Elephant Man&#39;?<br/><br/>Roll on &#39;War of the Worlds&#39;, big up Spielberg."
898,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,One of the most exciting movies I&#39;ve ever seen. With an emotional load that maybe I could only understand after a few years
2585,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I&#39;m ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don&#39;t feel that way when I watch it now.<br/><br/>For sure, I&#39;ll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn&#39;t feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I&#39;d probably just think it&#39;s a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering."
5003,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This Movie was filmed in 1971/2 but set in the 50&#39;s. Pulling off a period film with zero technology in such incredible detail is a testament to the director &amp; the production crew.<br/><br/>This is not a fast paced movie, it&#39;s genuinely a pice of art that doesn&#39;t try impress, but it may well capture you!!<br/><br/>Every aspect of the film is exceptional, there isn&#39;t a single poor performance, I can&#39;t think of a movie that comes close in terms of &#39;across the board&#39; acting.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is iconic but fits the film perfectly.<br/><br/>The story line is simply gripping from start to finish.<br/><br/>No Spoilers - but there is an Al Pacino scene that still makes my heart beat faster than any other!!"
364,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I&#39;m not going to tip toe around it, this film is crap. Its completely unoriginal, its not artistic, its not demanding (except for being boring). <br/><br/>You will not learn anything about the world through this film.<br/><br/>This film is not a part cinematic history, unlike nearly all other films in the top 250. <br/><br/>It is predictable and emotional crap.<br/><br/>But even if your not into cinema, and you just like popcorn entertainment there are far better movies out there...basically any on the video shelf."
5396,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It&#39;s hard to say what they could&#39;ve done better. Much like Titanic, everyone fits their role like they were born for it. It ages well and pays a hefty price, and it&#39;s smooth and has legs. Like any fine wine, this classic will be put on the topmost shelf of the cellar."
1075,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I think if u see this movie first time, surely you will fall in love with this movie.
Excellent work... 👌"
1102,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,Its my all time favorite movie. The twists and turns in the movie will amaze you to the core.
1169,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I thought I had never seen this movie before and then I happened upon it on TV. Then I realized I was required to see this movie in public school(in which I zoned out with boredom).<br/><br/>Basically it&#39;s a campy Forest Gump-like story of prison with the common tropes of rape and racism--but nothing like a real prison for most people--I mean who goes to prison and gets a cushy office job? <br/><br/>It&#39;s okay for a generic movie but as a prison story you will be left wanting.<br/><br/>In fact, here are a few reasons to see a different movie: <br/><br/>1 - The escape plan: It&#39;s silly and simple. Makes you think the prison was run by complete idiots. Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood is much better.<br/><br/>2 - The final escape: pretty anti-climatic. Just finally happens and then movie is basically over. Once again, go see Escape from Alcatraz if you&#39;re expecting extensive tunneling/swimming or something that makes you feel like the prisoner earned their freedom.<br/><br/>3 - If you want a prison story about that best captures the essence of the desire to be free watch Papillon. It&#39;s roughly based on the French penal colony system during WW2 and numerous escape attempts."
3705,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Story about a man, who is a gangster, and his relationship with family, encounters, businesses and many more. Nevertheless, despite being filmed fairly long ago, the movie is genuinely enjoyable and has very few boring parts."
525,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The best movie I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;ve seen her more than twenty times and it&#39;s always perfect. On the 10th year anniversary DVD edition Frank Darabont claims that the movie has helped people through divorces and losing love ones and so on, just see the movie and you&#39;ll understand why.<br/><br/>The scene were Andy Dufresne finally gets out of Shawshank and he&#39;s standing in the rain and raising his hands is one of the better scenes in the movie history. I&#39;ve got that poster up on my wall. It&#39;s amazing how you feel brightened when you see that particular scene.<br/><br/>Try seeing the movie a couple of times, and then reading the book which is written by Steven King, and then seeing the movie again. It pushes the movie up to another level and you&#39;ll like it more thereafter."
2910,tt0068646,The Godfather,Not many films stand the test of time but after almost 50 years this is still the gold standard of cinema. And rightfully so.
2898,tt0068646,The Godfather,One of the greatest sagas of all time!! I&#39;ve watched every single minute. The depth that writer takes is not easily written and the actors brings it to life with absolute brilliance.
1068,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"A very good description about a realistic film.
Long will be in the first place"
1149,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I have never seen a movie as powerful and inspiring as this one. There are many lessons to learn in each scene of this movie, which is among the best I have ever seen. I recommend watching it at least once."
2749,tt0068646,The Godfather,I like how they hid the gun BEHIND the cistern in the restaurant
4872,tt0068646,The Godfather,"First i thought that The men who stare at goats was bad and than i saw this..... VERY bad movie. I don&#39;t care how many people gave it a 10 (don&#39;t know why). I want to write my opinion. It is long, boring, a lot of talking, a lot families, names, doing &quot;buissnes&quot;.... Did i mention that it is boring? The movie lacks a good storyline. It doesn&#39;t matter how good the actors are if the movie is not interesting at all. There is no comedy, there is very little action, drama (here and there somebody gets killed). I had better fun watching politicians than this.<br/><br/>I just wasted 6 hours of my life. (together with the second part)<br/><br/>Better watch Scarface, Casino or Reservoir Dogs. My other movies are Braveheart, Gladiator, Shawshank, Lethal weapon, Black hawk down...."
84,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot; Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor  Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn&#39;t win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!"
2949,tt0068646,The Godfather,"No.1 Movie of all time? I think that&#39;s what ruined it for me, I sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life - but instead I ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3hours. <br/><br/>Everything about it just lacked in moving me, the vengeance was untouched, parts of the story seemed to obvious and other parts just left untouched. Thoroughly this was the most disappointing film I&#39;ve ever seen, not the worst, just the most disappointing. I&#39;m not trying to change anyone&#39;s thoughts on the film or make out the film is bad - just in case anyone gets the impression. <br/><br/>Thanks"
3455,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This isn&#39;t just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in film making and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. If i can give it 11 stars out of 10, i will."
3183,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a real masterpiece directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola. The screenplay, which is written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, is just perfect. All the actors did their best, which actually result in memorable performances. Marlon Brando was excellent. Regardless of the fact that The Godfather was one of his first movies Al Pacino was very good. The Godfather is one of the movies that make me love the cinema."
5538,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is one of the greatest immigrant stories I ever seen. The nostalgia and melancholia this movie portrait is just so close to many people&#39;s heart. We can see our own experiences, in the lives of these characters. From the beginning of the movie one can identify an uncle, or a family member with one of the characters. The story line just takes you in great journey, from the naïve and idealist Michael to the cold and calculated killer he becomes when he takes charge of the family business. The loss, the gains, the falls, and victories of the Corleone&#39;s family, we can feel them as ours as well. We can see how the moral code changes from Don Vito Corleone&#39;s leadership, and Michael&#39;s way to handled business. Don Vito Corleone to my point of view who have not killed his daughter&#39;s husband, for him it was all about the family, and community. I think Michael&#39;s difference was that everything was giving to him, and he grew up in an environment of richness, where in Don Vito Corleone, he suffered poverty, and worked really hard to get that kind of power, and his number one motive was the well being of family and community. Michael not having this kind of life experiences took a decision that marked his life, and we as spectators could live and suffer with these characters. <br/><br/>A wonderful movie to watch again and again, the more you watch it, knew things you&#39;ll be able to discover."
1337,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"For the life of me, I can&#39;t understand all the gushing about this cornball, sentimental and PHONY movie.  There are certainly some strong performances, but they&#39;re outweighed by some of the two-dimensional portrayals, weak writing (that opera sequence -- oh, please) and most of all a completely garbage ending (I won&#39;t give it away) that stomps on what little credibility the movie has.<br/><br/>I guess you really can&#39;t go broke under-estimating people&#39;s intelligence."
2258,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In the second part of the godfather, the old godfather went to kill the hooligans who forced them to pay protection money on a religious holiday, and the process can be described as extremely calm and cold-blooded. When I got home, I hugged my little son and said, &quot;Michael, Daddy loves you very much.&quot;<br/><br/>All admit that the second part is more or no less than the first. Because this book repeatedly compares the difference between these two fathers and sons. The old godfather was forced by life to join the gang, but he was very sober, one of his purposes was for the family, and the other was as mentioned in the first part, he continued to show favor to unrelated people, and used this as a hedge to keep himself from being completely limited to darkness.<br/><br/>Michael is different, ambitious, wants to climb up, and will do anything to do it, and in the end Kai also leaves him, and his subordinates are also dissatisfied, and his brother is against him and betrays him. And, of course, there is the adversary, who, because he ruthlessly swept away all obstacles in his way and killed the Jew&#39;s friend, the Jew designed him. In the end, as always, he killed his elder brother and purged all those who stood in his way, those who betrayed him, including Jews, subordinates, his brother, and apparently the Pope.<br/><br/>When people reach this point, they are betrayed and divorced. So in the third part, he ended up very tragically, lost his daughter, and died in loneliness.<br/><br/>His father was different, he was hunted down by the mafia in his hometown when he was a teenager and fled to the United States to live at the bottom. Later, he did a little illegal business and was forced to pay protection money by hooligans. Then he went to assassinate the scoundrel. Three shots were fired, the first shot knocked down the hooligan, the second shot prevented the hooligan from counterattacking, and then the second shot in the head to ensure that the hooligan died. Unusually calm, methodical, and a masterpiece, but unfortunately there is no way out. Later, he used gentlemanly language to threaten a landlord not to increase the rent of the widow tenant."
2005,tt0068646,The Godfather,I thought it was a nice movie and i&#39;m going to watch another one but you get 7 stars and 1 more for the great start and end i hope for more. And I also watch Dutch movies like circus noël.
3849,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[4]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[5] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[6] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990. The Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972. It earned $81.5 million in theatrical rentals in North America during its initial release,[30] increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in 1973,[31] and including a limited re-release in 1997 it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135 million.[2] It displaced Gone with the Wind to claim the record as the top rentals earner, a position it would retain until the release of Jaws in 1975.[32][33] News articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America,[32] but such accounts are erroneous since this record in fact belongs to The Sound of Music, released in 1965.[34] The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the highest net earner.[35] Profits were so high for The Godfather that earnings for Gulf &amp; Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount Pictures, jumped from seventy-seven cents per share to three dollars and thirty cents a share for the year, according to a Los Angeles Times article, dated December 13, 1972.[32] To date, it has grossed between $245 million and $286 million in worldwide box office receipts,[36] and adjusted for ticket price inflation in North America, ranks among the top 25 highest- grossing films"
1686,tt0068646,The Godfather,I think this is the best film ever done. All the actors did so well in the film..Specially Brando and Al Pacino won my heart.. I can see more than 100 times and still not boar.
259,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;ve always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn&#39;t let me down here. But I can&#39;t believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, &#39;The Player&#39;, &#39;Short Cuts&#39; and &#39;Jacob&#39;s Ladder&#39; are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I&#39;m not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can&#39;t explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it&#39;s the &#39;American Factor&#39;, what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me."
110,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"One of the best movies ever made. Simple as that. Top 20 ever, and top 3 of the 90s. The ending is just so powerful."
3359,tt0068646,The Godfather,"My favorite movie of all-time!

2750,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and holding an unforgettable place in cinema history, is a masterpiece. The film focuses on the Corleone family&#39;s involvement in the world of crime, while also exploring themes of family values, loyalty, and power.<br/><br/>The film stands out with a deliberate yet profoundly impactful pace. By delving into character development and the intricacies of relationships, it presents the audience with a rich and poignant narrative. Marlon Brando&#39;s unforgettable performance as Don Vito Corleone breathes life into the characters.<br/><br/>The theme of &quot;power&quot; is one of the central elements of the film. The complexity behind the Corleone family&#39;s criminal empire, the challenges of the pursuit of power, and ethical dilemmas prompt viewers to contemplate. Additionally, the family&#39;s loyalty and devotion form the deeply explored emotional dimension of the film.<br/><br/>Adapted from Mario Puzo&#39;s novel, &quot;The Godfather&quot; boasts a highly intricate plot. This richness contributes to the film&#39;s captivating and immersive quality. The meticulously crafted atmosphere and attention to detail create an intense world, allowing viewers to intimately experience the underbelly of the criminal underworld and the characters&#39; internal conflicts.<br/><br/>However, the film&#39;s deliberate pace might test the patience of some viewers. The in-depth character development and intricate web of relationships might not satisfy those expecting fast-paced action.<br/><br/>In conclusion, &quot;The Godfather&quot; remains a masterpiece, despite its deliberate pace, due to its intricate narrative and rich character depth. Addressing universal themes such as power, family values, and loyalty, it has secured a significant place in cinematic history."
5186,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is the second best film ever made.  Only &quot;The Godfather part 2&quot; is better.  Nothing else need be said, but since I ave to get four lines I will point out that Pacino&#39;s transformation in this film is one of the most moving performances in history"
1188,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"is the best movie ever made i love it This movie made me laugh and it made me cry, This is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite movie ranked in my top 5 list. The movie is based in a prison, where violence, sexual references and profanity are part of the daily life. The story line is excellent with great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman especially. I have watched this movie over 20 times and still enjoy it every time I see it just as much as the first time."
1872,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I was pretty disappointing i need to admit. But i wait for a moment and think about something: what they can do with a gang involved in a organised crimes, families&#39;s honour? Just some people who handling the business. I found also the start of Michael very good to watch and interesting to see. He is not uused to do this but learn. I found the movie pretty classic sadly. The violent scenes looks outdated now. What i found interesting i mean in the cinematography was at the end: the opposition of violence and the church scenes. That was interesting to see and look interesting visually. And the fall of Don Corleone make the whole thing more hard for the son, Michael. I also found the characters&#39;s arcs interesting and what they become. I enjoyed also the dialogues and have strong acts with families and honour. But it look really superficial but what i found really strong is the end: because we see the fall with the Don Corleone and the rise at the end with the new status of the Kid: Michael become the Godfather. And the image at the end was so meaningful and look the same as the father in some way."
330,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Great film. Well written, with very well developed characters. I loved the ending and how it rounded off the story very nicely.<br/><br/>Controversial opinion however; perhaps I expected more from the movie, and walked into it expecting the best thing I have ever seen because of the ratings. Maybe not knowing how well the movie has been received might have made me enjoy it more.<br/><br/>Either way, really fantastic film."
1468,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I must admit, i&#39;ve never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i&#39;ve seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.<br/><br/>But i never get into it.<br/><br/>The plot is ok but i wanted more.<br/><br/>I wanted to go deeper into the &quot;why&quot; and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.<br/><br/>They just &quot;looked&quot; and there was silence.<br/><br/>I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called &quot;masterpiece&quot;. But it didn&#39;t happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly &quot;bored&quot;.<br/><br/>I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.<br/><br/>The characters are all not so relatable, i didn&#39;t felt their feelings.<br/><br/>Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn&#39;t even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/><br/>For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.<br/><br/>I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn&#39;t do it...that says a lot for myself."

2359,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This isn&#39;t just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in film making and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. If i can give it 11 stars out of 10, i will."
3346,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I honestly can&#39;t understand those who voted one star for this movie: probably they&#39;re trying to counter-balance the great number of 9 and 10 given by many viewers. This movie is complete, with very good actors, enchanting music and a nice plot. The behavior of the characters and their way of speaking is accurate, the atmosphere of the scenes set in Sicily is real and so is the portrait of a &quot;famiglia&quot; with that kind of activities. This movie is the &quot;standard&quot; for all the following movies about mafia and it created a collective imaginary about this subject like no other movie. Some parts may be a bit long, but if you start enjoying the moves, the glares and the dialogues of the characters you will like them just like the action parts. I don&#39;t know if this movie deserves to be #1 of all times but surely it&#39;s the best movie of the genre I&#39;ve ever seen."
4909,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I first saw The Godfather around 25 years ago, long before I became a film buff. I thought it was good, not great. When registering on IMDB a decade ago I rated it a 7/10 from memory. Incidentally part II I rated a little higher, an 8/10 due to the engaging flashbacks.<br/><br/>Ten years of being a film buff...I&#39;ve seen some incredible works in that time (including two Coppolas, namely his Apocalypse Now &amp; Dracula). Curious if The Godfathers are as good as their 9.2/9.0 ratings on here, I purchased the Bluray-Restoration Trilogy and just now watched the 3-hour first movie...only my second watch, and the first time since 25 years or so.<br/><br/>....and my opinion is unchanged! The Godfather is a good film. It&#39;s very well made, with tons of neat intelligent scenes and dialogue. Well acted. Fitting music. Decent camera work. But it&#39;s also tricky to follow, a few times I wondered who characters were referencing...this isn&#39;t a problem I&#39;ve had with Goodfellas or Sopranos. Michael&#39;s relationship drama with his two wives isn&#39;t really that compelling, and neither is the paranoid mob war. The motives of the antagonist mobsters don&#39;t feel convincing.<br/><br/>A couple of action scenes have dated badly. One scene has Sonny punching clear air but the sound effects are claiming contact. Tho&#39; the death scenes were generally done well and still look good today.<br/><br/>Curiously, there&#39;s often no offered subtitles when the characters talk in Italian. Specifically an important restaurant scene is missing this. I later watched an online clip with the translation, and I disagree with Copolla: the subs should&#39;ve stayed in. Also, the image-quality isn&#39;t that impressive for a claimed 4k-mastering restoration. Very deep blacks for indoor scenes, meaning you struggle to differentiate among all those black suits. I guess they were going for a chiaroscuro-style (like Caravaggio famously employed in his paintings), so this gets a pass.<br/><br/>7/10 feels absolutely fair. Yet poll after poll still puts this movie right at the top (or very close) in the all-time rankings.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is one of those I feel deserves such a reputation. The Godfather...not so much.<br/><br/>Part II next. Let&#39;s see if it holds its 8/10 (hopefully improves on it!)."
1095,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"im Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....<br/><br/>I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn&#39;t even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison."

The way it pulls you into the world of the Corleone family is incredible. I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off the screen. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone? Absolutely legendary. And Al Pacino&#39;s transformation throughout the film? Mind-blowing. The story is so rich and complex, but it never loses you. It&#39;s like you&#39;re right there, part of this dangerous, fascinating world. The scenes, the music, the tension - it all comes together perfectly. I found myself holding my breath during some parts! It&#39;s not just a gangster movie; it&#39;s about family, power, and tough choices. I can see why everyone calls it a masterpiece. Honestly, I&#39;m still thinking about it days later. If you haven&#39;t seen it, you&#39;re seriously missing out. It&#39;s long, but trust me, it&#39;s worth every minute. This is definitely going on my list of all-time favorites!"

This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, &quot;Is it The Godfather level good or not ?&quot;.<br/><br/>This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn&#39;t find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).<br/><br/>With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.<br/><br/>It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather&#39;s mansion. <br/><br/>All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of &quot;Bravo!&quot;.

To the word, it is the color and storyline basis of «Godfather» has won recognition of many critics and lovers of similar cinema. The background, excluding Sicilian landscapes and grape fields, is less dynamic, giving preference to acting. The risk was high, as the producers of the film had long been unable to understand the situation inside the work, taking away Coppola&#39;s directorial powers, and removing Brando from the main role. And what is most gratifying is that the end result has already been recognized as a classic, and the leading performers will remain in the annals of history for a long time to come. Everyone must see this masterpiece! 10 out of 10"
1345,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"My Rating : 9.5/10<br/><br/>&#39;Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.&#39;<br/><br/>This is the thoughtful and paradoxical tagline of the prison-drama saga entitled &#39;The Shawshank Redemption&#39;.<br/><br/>With a runtime of 2 hours and 22 minutes, The Shawshank Redemption is truly director Frank Darabont&#39;s baby. But does it serve to be a dream come true for the viewers? The answer is a resounding yes, according to me.<br/><br/>Though it failed miserably at the time of release it is now heralded as one of the greatest of the greatest that the medium of cinema has ever seen. It is #1 on the imdb Top 250.<br/><br/>It is an impressive, engrossing filmmaking masterpiece adapted from the horror prodigy Stephen King&#39;s 1982 novella &#39;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&#39;. With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as its main characters, the movie offers marvelous acting although Robbins&#39; Andy Dufresne scores low with respect to his overall energy I feel. It almost seems artificial, bland and repetitive. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red (Morgan Freeman) is a blend of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed in his past. His friendship with Andy is the film&#39;s main highlight.<br/><br/>The inspirational, life-affirming and uplifting, old-fashioned style (the music and some of the cinematography) Hollywood production (Castle Rock Entertainment) is a combination of a prison-drama film as well as excellent character study. The film takes the-innocent-man-in-prison theme and gives it a new angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the film ventures down a less-travelled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars of the prison cell. As one of the character puts it : &quot;These walls are funny. First, you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them.&quot; This is the case with Brooks (excellently portrayed by James Whitmore) who is completely institutionalized and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of prison represents one of the film&#39;s most moving and effective sequences.<br/><br/>The chiaroscuro of the entire film is incredible and of the scenes which leaves an impression on one&#39;s mind is one when Andy, after escaping from the prison, expresses his joy and freedom by looking up at the dark sky and his upward-facing hands welcoming raindrops to fall over his body.<br/><br/>Darabont&#39;s film is a patiently-told, allegorical tale (unfolding like a long-played, sometimes painstakingly long chess game) of friendship, hope, survival, emancipation and ultimate redemption and salvation by the time of the film&#39;s finale.<br/><br/>However, on the downside, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the film deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The all-too-predictable final twenty two minutes move a little slowly and my heart goes out to Darabont who displays a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is undoubtedly great and only time will tell if it holds up another 25 or so years down the line. It&#39;s already been 24 years but I hope the future generations enjoy it just as much and not be put off by the pace and style of the narrative. 9/10."
2880,tt0068646,The Godfather,"First I would like to state that I am 20 years old this movie was made 16 years after I was born, but it is my favorite movie of all time. I really get annoyed when I hear this nonsense about young people can&#39;t judge movies because they haven&#39;t seen all the classics, well I have seen them all , Casablanca, Citizen Kane, On the Waterfront, North by Northwest and so on. I own all three of these movies, and the original is the best, 2 is very close to the original and 3 is decent. I also hate these people who judge this movie poorly because its all about Italians its pathetic I read so many comments here and everywhere that the sole basis of a poor rating is it being about Italians its a joke, Like in on the waterfront when Marlon Brando&#39;s character, transitions from a goon for organized crime to at the end of the film a changed man who wants to be a better man, Michael Corleone&#39;s character I feel is the greatest transformation in all of film history, he changes from this nice quiet military, war hero, good citizen, to a dark, ruthless, emotionless character, which he really has to do the collapse of his family. That alone i think makes this movie great, not to forget how great Marlon Brando is in this along with James Caan and Robert Duvall. This movie broke a lot of barriers in film, starting a lot of trends and setting standards for so many other mafia movies, like Goodfellas, and the Departed etc... I really think that if you have never seen it you should invest some time because you will not be disappointed."
3411,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I was born in 2000 so when I hear about old classic movies such as this one, I&#39;m always scared that it will not hold up for a modern audience, that it might be too slow or outdated or etc.<br/><br/>Let me tell you that this movie holds up, even in 2024, when I watched this for the first time. The acting work is phenomenal. Cinemotography is outstanding and the writing is really good as well. As a young person, I can recognize a lot of pop-culture references that I now know to originate from this movie. That was really fun and eye opening to see. The reason that I will not give this a 10 is because of a few moments in this movie where the plot does movie quite slow."
3284,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I&#39;ve seen some great movies, but the Godfather is more than a movie. The Godfather is more than an epic. The Godfather was years ahead of its time. In fact, if the movie were to be made today, it would STILL be years ahead of its time.<br/><br/>The movie was EXTREMELY long, and the beginning moved a little slow, but there was never a point where I thought to myself the movie was boring. There are a few scenes that take you by surprise, and a lot of plot twists.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando and Al Pacino acted out their parts well. As ruthless as their characters were, as bad as the things they&#39;ve done, you never cease to hope they get the last laugh. <br/><br/>This movie was so dark, it&#39;s as if death was at every corner, and it was. The Godfather was an action movie with a story... a GOOD story. How often do we see those? Try never. <br/><br/>I heard from everybody that this is the greatest movie ever, and my expectations for this movie grew and grew with every comment (I heard millions, and my expectations were already high). I saw the movie, and even with expectations as high as mine were, It was STILL more than what I expected. If you haven&#39;t seen this movie yet, I make YOU an offer you can&#39;t refuse: go see it."
4549,tt0068646,The Godfather,"For a film that is almost 50 years old now, the story is brilliant, the acting, sensational especially from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. I watched this movie for the first time about 2 weeks ago now and wish I had seen it sooner. There are very few films that I would give a 10/10 to but the godfather takes the cake with the cherry on top, for those who like a good story, brilliant acting, a bit of the mafia, guns blazing, this is your cuppa, it certainly is mine. Utterly incredible, now I just need to watch part 2 and 3!"
603,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this film is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of the other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is tremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper meaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is your greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his great escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is always meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds when Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends with, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later in the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is finally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same situation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself didn&#39;t commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend again and to &quot;give him a handshake&quot;. And as the movie comes to a marvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.<br/><br/>Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I will continue to keep watching it again and again and again."

I would watch the sequal to this just so I could be qualify to right a review on Godfather 2 (which stars Roger DeNiro from The Joker) where he actually goes back to Mexico and they actually speak -in- Mexican for the Hole Movie. But I dont want to be any more offended or bored by old, cheap nobody movies like this anymore...<br/><br/>TLDR: Just go to the nearest street-corner where the Spanish people like in this movey sell drugs and buy some heroin because Nodding off from that is much cheaper, shorter and funner than watching the Nod Fathers."

It has a great cast that turns in some good performances, and the story is compelling; however, I always feel so empty after I see it.  I get a similar vibe from FORREST GUMP and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, to name a couple others. I can&#39;t really figure out why."

4685,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a great movie and, in a series of three, the quality didn&#39;t diminish.  The second installment won the Oscar for best picture, and it deserved it.  However for those who read the book first, it is all familiar territory. Marlon Brando has only been better in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and Al Pacino has never been better, that is saying something.  The film is perfect, almost. The book is better than the film and rarely get&#39;s mentioned.  Emotion is there, but an age old stereotype get&#39;s enforced along the way.  Everything else is perfect and earns the honour of being a true classic.  The problem with the first installment, the second one was somehow better."
3919,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is rightly regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, and this review won&#39;t seek to be a mere repetition of its finest qualities. Technically, thematically and theatrically, the film is an undeniable masterpiece. It took what is an enjoyable, but pulpy, populist crime novel into a deft piece of art. One can only attempt to highlight some interesting observations here.<br/><br/>Watching this again recently with friends who have never seen it before is an interesting experiment. After seeing the film numerous times one forgets that the story and the characters, while never particularly convoluted, are nevertheless numerous, steeped in a subtly defined hierarchy that for the uninitiated is overwhelming, to say the least. Especially overseas (Britain in this case), the younger generation have to fill in gaps that would have been closer to common knowledge upon release in the US. Notwithstanding its wide berth of characters and relationships, the film&#39;s central arc, that of Michael Corleone&#39;s (Al Pacino) descent to Don, is never clouded; Part II, while arguably as good if not better than Part I, suffers initially from juggling multiple arcs that while well-crafted and excellent, are not nearly as accessible.<br/><br/>While all remember the set pieces, particularly the wedding and baptism that masterfully bookend the film, on multiple viewings it&#39;s the quieter, thematic scenes that really shine. A personal favourite scene is the last scene shared between Michael and Vito (Marlon Brando) discussing Vito&#39;s desires for Michael, which merges duty, family and aspiration in a truly touching scene. One can make a serious argument that The Godfather Saga is really an embodiment of the American dream (note the Statue of Liberty in the &#39;cannoli&#39; scene background), and Vito&#39;s entire outlook captures this. The scene is certainly the thematic backbone of the movie.<br/><br/>What has been occasionally discussed in detail elsewhere, but deserves a mention, is the portrayal of Kay. It&#39;s a nuanced performance by Diane Keaton, and the costume design is a fantastic touch. In her scenes where she is most distant, Kay&#39;s colours are bright reds and oranges, in sharp contrast to the surrounding characters (the wedding; when she looks for Michael at the compound). As she falls in with the family, her colours become muted. In terms of gender portrayal (something the film almost-understandably struggles with; it never comes close to passing the Bechdel test), Kay certainly fares better as a character than Apollonia, who is little more than an object of desire. Her willingness to be there for Michael is almost questionable however. Yet, ultimately this is a quintessential story about men, in a world where women had not yet encroached as individuals separate from men (it&#39;s no accident that the women get a greater role in Part III). One can suggest that the fact that all the women are defined by their male connections is less the fault of the material than it is the reality of the profession and period.<br/><br/>The Godfather, possibly by virtue of being a period piece, has barely aged in 40 years. Sure, the issues it discusses and the world it portrays are transformed, but like a painting it captures beautifully a freeze frame, a snapshot period of aspiration and ambition. It will continue to be adored for years to come."
3990,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is the best movie of my lifetime. And of course, Marlon Brando being the best of the best."
1150,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,Really this film is simply a string of cliches and is mediocre in every way.
4867,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This film attracts a world-wide, almost cult-like following, with its depth, design and artistic boldness that has shined from the moment of its release, right through to present day. I will review the film from a particular angle: The broad-way slide to destruction.<br/><br/>&quot;Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.&quot; -Romans 6:12.&quot;The Godfather&quot; Part I is beautifully directed and methodically scripted. The antithesis of its gentle filming approach weaved in the explosive and gripping content, is the head of the hammer that hit 70&#39;s cinema hard. Is nice."
2689,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Personally, I found this movie to be quite overrated. Even though it was a good movie, I see very little that makes it great. The movie is long, and often long winded. The only standout that I see is Brando&#39;s incredible acting. Mr. Brando and Al Pacino both make this long film bearable."

Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s masterpiece of cinema and one of the most memorable films of all time: Brando (Best Actor) gives a superb performance as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a Long Island crime family who faces all sorts of dilemmas, most of which embroil his youngest son Michael (Pacino in a star-making role), fresh from WWII, who takes on the awesome task of being the next leader in crime, violence and double-crossing. Great ensemble cast and some truly remarkable moments captured on film: offering film studio head Marley &quot;an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot; resulting with a horse&#39;s head in bed; assassination attempts and successes (Caan&#39;s hot-tempered Sonny buying the farm at a toll booth massacre the likes of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;) and the piece de resistance of baptism of Michael&#39;s&#39; godson and the wiping out of his enemies is the stuff of Greek legend. Pure filmmaking at its best. Oscar winner for Best Picture, adapted screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his best seller) and some beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis (suggesting a Rembrandt painting come to life). Pacino, Caan and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor (all losing to Joel Grey in &quot;Cabaret&quot;).

3793,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I must say that I did not like Godfather when i saw it for the first time. This may have something to do with the fact that i was 10 years old and loved Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies. I watched it again when i was 17 and i was blown away by the beauty (and tragedy) of the movie.<br/><br/>I can understand why everyone does not enjoy Godfather. It is quite slow paced and does not necessarily appeal to a viewer who is used to gangster movies with lot of action in them, movies with &#39;dramatic&#39; Hollywood soundtrack and movies that have quick &#39;dramatic&#39; plot twists.<br/><br/>First of all, you must remember that this is is not a gangster movie. This is a movie about family. This is movie about responsibilities. So if you are waiting to see Scarface then you are in for a big disappointment.<br/><br/>Best part of the movie is the story. Movie tells us tale of the youngest son of the American-Sicilian mafia family. Tale of the son who has decided to live his life by the laws of the united states and not have anything to do with businesses of his family. But through the tragedy that brings the whole family together, son is little by little drawn back to illegal side of family. Finally son becomes what he did not want to be. What he despised. Because of the responsibilities to the family he forgets his ambitions and plans and becomes the Godfather.<br/><br/>Coppola has really got the best performance out of the actors in this movie. Every emotion of Michael and other characters is forwarded to viewer. Special mention to the cast of this movie. I have not seen a movie with better casting. Cinematography of the movie may be a little out of date but it still is really really beautiful. Especially beautiful sets in Sicily deserve a mention. Nino Rota&#39;s soundtrack supports the drama of the movie in a way that I can hardly think of the soundtrack that does this better.<br/><br/>All in all, i love this movie. If you combine first two films, you get the classical story of man changing to what he does not want to be. Classical story about rise and the fall of the man who turns from kind and loving person to ambitious, greedy and paranoid leader who pushes all his loved ones away. Story not too far from another one of the greatest movies of all time. Story not too far from Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>And oh yes. I will dance Speak softly love in my wedding next august."

Any movie that is close to the top 10 should be a movie that gives you MEANING outside of the theater, not a movie about false organized crime!  How the hell did this movie get #1 if it&#39;s just a movie about killing?  The only movie I can think of that should get #1 is American Beauty."
3038,tt0068646,The Godfather,Spectacular Movie and The Godfather is my Favourite Film and Al Pacino is a great actor and I like Marlon Brando Acting in the Godfather film. The world&#39;s greatest movie is Godfather and World&#39;s Greatest Actor is Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.
1508,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo&#39;s novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it&#39;s still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today&#39;s standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.<br/><br/>I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is &#39;The Godfather&#39;. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes."
2889,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie isnt that good but it&#39;s definitely not bad. Everyone talks about this movie like it&#39;s some masterpiece but quite frankly it&#39;s boring in some scenes, got to so bored the first time watching that I stopped watching a few times that day."
5288,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.<br/><br/>Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.<br/><br/>John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. <br/><br/>The story of one man&#39;s reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.<br/><br/>Do not miss this film!"
401,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Let me just say: I&#39;m embarrassed it took me until the age of 31 to watch The Shawshank Redemption. This film was released the same year I was born, and somehow, despite the countless mentions, references, and praise, I kept pushing it off. I wish I hadn&#39;t.<br/><br/>Because this isn&#39;t just a movie. It&#39;s twenty movies in one - each scene, each character arc, each little moment is like its own perfectly crafted short story, and together they build to a revelation so powerful it hits like a spiritual awakening.<br/><br/>What amazes me most is how layered the experience is. It&#39;s not just about prison. It&#39;s not just about hope. It&#39;s about everything: friendship, injustice, solitude, dignity, the human spirit, fear of change, and the raw terror of freedom. Every character is written with such care and detail, even the minor ones - you feel their entire lives in just a glance or a line of dialogue.<br/><br/>There are scenes that will break your heart quietly. Others that will grip your chest. And then there are those rare moments where you realize you&#39;re watching something eternal - one of those &quot;cinema as therapy&quot; kinds of moments that burrow into your soul.<br/><br/>Watching it now, I can only describe it as a long, slow, beautiful unfolding of truth. It&#39;s meditative. It doesn&#39;t rush. It lets you live with these people. And by the end, you don&#39;t just understand Andy and Red - you understand something deeper about yourself.<br/><br/>I genuinely think this is the kind of film you don&#39;t watch, you experience. And then you carry it with you.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re like me - if you somehow haven&#39;t seen this film yet - stop reading this and fix that immediately.<br/><br/>I waited 31 years. I won&#39;t stop thinking about it for the rest of my life."
4473,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is a great film. And it is also the most over-hyped film of all time. I enjoyed the script and the acting. A little slow in some spots, and it failed to grab my attention emotionally. But it was a good 8/10."
629,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Ten Thumbs Up if I had them. Incredible story, incredible cast. I would rate this as probably the best film I have ever seen and I have probably seen it a hundred times on cable. I would have to say this would be Morgan Freemans best performance out of all of his films. There should have been an Oscar for him. This film definitely beat out &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; for which he ultimately and finally received his first Oscar. The Academy wasn&#39;t all there when &quot;Shawshank&quot; deserved its due. Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however Freeman carried the film. A true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances. Yes, this one is one to own, if you don&#39;t have it...buy it. You wont be disappointed."
1028,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"One of the most emotional films i have ever watched. From the escape to the tool in the book to a certain old man commiting suicide, the movie had me captivated and was a rollercoaster of feelings. Its easily one of the greatest pieces of movie artwork ive ever seen and there are only a handful of other movies that come close to shawshank. Morgan freeman,James whitmore and Tim Robbins carried this to greatness."
5215,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Though I don&#39;t think The Godfather should be the #2 movie on the top 250, I understand it&#39;s importance to the industry. I understand that there&#39;s more depth in The Godfather than most movies of the time. I don&#39;t know, I keep a pretty open mind to movies and the different eras they were made in. 1970-1980 just isn&#39;t a popular decade for me. So far, The Godfather series is probably the best thing to come out of this era (or at least the first two). It&#39;s a pretty big hit. I loved it. I just didn&#39;t love it as much as the movie masses do even to this day. The story is rich, and Vito Corleone is easily one of my favorite characters of all time now. The death scenes are brutal and hard-hitting. The director didn&#39;t waste a single gunshot or strangulation for the sake of just doing it. There&#39;s a method to the madness of The Godfather, and I guess thats&#39; why it hits people so hard. They story is built up in a way to where the killing of a character hits just as hard as your favorite character leaving the cast of your favorite sitcom.<br/><br/>The scene in the garden with Don Vito and his grandson is by far my favorite. Out of all the ways I&#39;d expect it to happen, It took me by surprise. It was a very sweet and heartfelt scene, and the character was too worthy of it. I would&#39;ve been angry if Vito ended as a victim, and not the legend... the Godfather.<br/><br/>Check this movie out. There&#39;s a good reason why it&#39;s such an important movie to the industry. Other than that - it&#39;s just a fantastic piece of cinema, and touches on a few topics we can all relate to: Honor, Nobility, and Family."
3939,tt0068646,The Godfather,"When a prestige movie is made, utmost attention is given to detail, grandeur, style, and above all, popularity.  Godfather was a movie made to honor the great work of Mario Puzo, who wrote a novel that brought true attention to the human side of the gangster/mobster.  Capolla knew that he had embarked on a great mission when he set out to perform the unthinkable: to show the world that the leaders in crime have souls, and that they are certainly not invincible.  This movie was what it was meant to be, a prestige movie, it took very few risks, and was filmed to simply document the lives of its characters.<br/><br/>I found the Godfather to be a very well done movie.  In fact, I enjoyed this movie so much that I have watched it on many occasions.  This movie serves as a soap opera of the gangster world to me, and it tells its story very well.  However, I do not believe that any film of this character should be given such a high accord in the Top 100 ranking.  The highest position on the rating scale should be given to a movie that fulfills the requirements of a movie to the tee.  The godfather does not do this as precisely as other movies.<br/><br/>People go to see movies simply to be displaced from their ordinary lives. To be transported to another world, life, place, or perspective.  The godfather does a very feeble attempt at fulfilling this essential requirement.  Not at one moment in this movie does the audience become disconnected with themselves.  There is not a single instance where the actions on the screen become real, and where the world in which the audience is watching from fades away.  To those of us who believe in the true excellence of movies, the Godfather does not rate anywhere near the `best movie of all time&#39;.<br/><br/>Movies such as Moulin Rouge, Citizen Kane, Requiem for a Dream, the Matrix, Casablanca, Momento, and even (depending on the viewer) Gladiator, all grasp the viewer by their hair, and thrust them into another world, if for only a few seconds.  The movie watching experience is topped by this disconnection from the real world.  It leaves us in a feeling of awe, and shows us that the movie we just watched was more than just a movie, but a journey into the minds of the characters on the screen, and in some unique cases, a journey into the great depths of our own minds.  With this sort of depth and greatness, these types of movies should be all in the top 10.<br/><br/>This unique greatness is not easily achieved.  In order to capture the audience in such a thrilling way, a great deal of effort must be spend meticulously building up the pace and timing of the movie.  The climax should be the point where the viewer has already been captured into the movie, and should thus create a `climatic experience&#39;, thus blowing the viewer away.  The Godfather has none of these elements perfected to such a state that they encapsulate the viewing public to a degree worthy of its ranking.<br/><br/>So it is therefore obvious that The Godfather does not reach the greatness of a few other better movies, and so it is not deserving of its top ranking. If it were up to me, I would move the Godfather down to 5 or 6, and leave room the real screen gems to be appreciated.<br/><br/>This movie gets a rating of 9 out of 10"
4343,tt0068646,The Godfather,Simply amazing. This is probably the only 3 hour movie I would ever watch
3044,tt0068646,The Godfather,Yeah that&#39;s it. I learnt that need to contain at least 150 characters. And i don&#39;t want to write something i just want to give 10 to this movie. My dad is fan of this movie also my grandfather is too. So it&#39;s important thing for my family. Actually it isnt important but i have to write something bro you know.
5683,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I mean, really, what hasn&#39;t been said about this film yet? That&#39;s right, nothing, and so I&#39;ll now write a review that doesn&#39;t go anywhere.<br/><br/>There are those that say this (or maybe pt2) is the best movie ever made, but I couldn&#39;t agree with that. One of the best, yes, but not the best. And then you have those who say it&#39;s overrated and boring. I think those people are just not used to extremely long movies anymore, and that&#39;s sad, because these people are missing out on some other awesome long movies (casino, GF 1,2,3, Heat, Once upon a time in the west, etc.) Anyway, back to the movie. It was the breakthrough for several great actors, including Marlon Brando, in the brilliant role of the compassionate but cruel Don Corleone, and Al Pacino of course, in the role of Michael, the Don&#39;s son who didn&#39;t want to take over the Corleone empire at first but in the end does anyway. When I fist sat down to see this movie it was with thoughts of &#39;overrated&#39; and &#39;way too long&#39;, but the 2h55 just flew by, really. Though it was the longest movie I&#39;d ever seen, it felt no longer than say Inception, which is 30min shorter and (in my opinion) a really boring movie, and at the end I couldn&#39;t wait for pt2, so it was a convenience that I had it standing right next to me in my DVD-rack."
5238,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One problem I have with the godfather it lacked tension cause I was pretty bored throughout the whole film. Nothing really going on in the movie that capture my attention maybe beside the one scene where Al pacino gf died in a car explosion. Im all for dialogue between characters if done right but this one I can&#39;t see to engaged by it due to director bad directing in the movie. The camerawork has big part of the movie being boring cause the director use the basic camera work back and back forth on the face when having the conversation between the character as opposed of thinking of new camera angel to get the audience engaged by the dialogue. The characters talking in the movie is like how someone talk in quiet place that has no energy and no personality which failed to engage when we watch it. If I want to watch that, I will listen to my parents in a conversation when we eating dinner which will be more entertaining. Also all characters have no personality, their just so egoistic an narcissistic that it&#39;s hard to root for them. The movie is just lifeless dull so I don&#39;t get why it&#39;s considered a masterpiece to cinema ."
5411,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Godfather Trilogy, is a masterpiece of international cinematography!"
5138,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In my opinion &quot;The Godfather&quot; is, in every way, the best film ever made."
230,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).<br/><br/>Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It&#39;s his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.<br/><br/>If there is one complaint, it is Andy&#39;s claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy&#39;s demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It&#39;s a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable."
3909,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Watching The Godfather is an emotional experience unlike any other. It stirs something deep within me-a mix of awe, melancholy, and introspection. The film doesn&#39;t just tell a story; it pulls me into the world of the Corleones, making me feel the weight of their choices and the darkness that power inevitably brings. The portrayal of loyalty, betrayal, and ambition resonates on a profound level, leaving me questioning the balance between duty and desire.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando&#39;s presence as Vito Corleone evokes a sense of respect and fear, while Al Pacino&#39;s journey as Michael leaves me both fascinated and saddened by how power transforms him. Each scene, every whispered word and look, carries an emotional gravity that lingers long after the movie ends. It&#39;s not just a film-it&#39;s a reflection on the sacrifices made in pursuit of power and the unyielding ties of family, and it always leaves me feeling haunted and contemplative."
726,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film with a perfect cast and a wise plot. It had its good times, had entertainment and lead us to some reflections about life. Sadly it had some predictable conversations and seemed to be just another Morgan Freeman&#39;s movie. It dares to almost offend our intelligence the fact that the prison officers didn&#39;t check that poster carefully one single time in twenty years. And I have two questions: was the American justice that weak back in 1994? Were the condemned all smart and good people as this movie portrayed?<br/><br/>If it deserves to be at 1st spot here? Maybe. If it became one of my favorite movies? No, just a good watch."
4181,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather, often hailed as one of the greatest films in cinema history, earns a 6/10 from me. While the movie is undoubtedly well-crafted and features stellar performances, its lengthy runtime diminishes its appeal somewhat, particularly for viewers who prefer a more concise narrative.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s strengths are numerous: it offers profound insights into family and power dynamics, and the performances are exceptional, particularly Marlon Brando&#39;s iconic role as Vito Corleone. The storytelling is rich and complex, filled with memorable lines and scenes that have become a part of popular culture.<br/><br/>However, the extensive duration of the film can be a detractor. The slow pacing and intricate plot, while contributing to the depth and texture of the film, also make it a demanding watch. This length can be challenging for viewers who may struggle to maintain attention through slower scenes and a sprawling narrative that takes its time to unfold.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Godfather is a classic that offers much in terms of character development and narrative depth. However, its extended length and slow pacing make it less accessible for some, reflected in the 6/10 rating. It&#39;s a film that demands patience and attention, rewarding those who appreciate detailed storytelling but potentially alienating those who prefer a quicker pace."
2073,tt0068646,The Godfather,I was interested in one of the most highly reviewed movies of all time and I was not super disappointed but also not super impressed.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are good even though I think there are way too many and the movie should have focused on fewer but more extensively. The acting of the main characters was great but there were many performances on the side which almost made me laugh (at scenes which should not be funny). The cinematography is good. Overall I would say it is a fine movie but I will probably not watch it again soon. Though I liked the ending which pulled all of the stories together.<br/><br/>I feel like many people only remember: I&#39;ll make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse; and think it is the most iconic thing in a movie that ever happened.

3901,tt0068646,The Godfather,"There isn&#39;t much that hasn&#39;t already been said concerning the excellence of The Godfather. Nonetheless, I present the umpteenth dissertation on why not giving The Godfather four out of four stars is about as unjust as sentencing an innocent man to death.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s 1972 effort is truly an epic for the ages. The acting, directing, cinematography, score, and script are all of the highest possible calibermaking the near three-hour running time more of a blessing than an inconvenience. The Godfather is not only the Don of all Mafia melodrama, but it is also the standard grade of superiority for critics and filmmakers alike.<br/><br/>Based on Mario Puzo&#39;s bestseller of the same name, the story begins in 1945 at the wedding of Connie (Talia Shire), the daughter of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Even on his daughter&#39;s day of celebration, Don Vito still manages to take care of &quot;business.&quot; After a few men grace his presence and ask for a few favors  revenge, a leading role, etc.  the Don unites with his family for the ceremony. His youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who has recently returned home from war a hero, brings his new love Kay (Diane Keaton), and the Don&#39;s two older sons, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), along with his &quot;adopted&quot; son and confidant Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), also come to celebrate their sister&#39;s special occasion.<br/><br/>With each of the five major mob families straining to gain ground on one another, the budding industry of narcotics presents a forum for a few to achieve a competitive advantage. However, it is Don Vito who declines Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), the drug supplier, of his offer to commence an involvement in narcotics trafficking. His son and heir apparent, Sonny, obviously disagrees with his father&#39;s choice  seeing that drugs are the wave of the future  but the Godfather does not concede. Don Vito understands that the drug industry is a cutthroat business where friends are few and far between. It is this rejection that spirals the Corleone family down a brutal one-way street that will both cost the five families many lives, and allow a new Don to emerge.<br/><br/>Al Pacino plays the supporting role of Michael with fire in his eyes. His transformation, from a civilian to a Godfather in both senses of the term, is the film&#39;s main and most dynamic storyline. In almost every sense, Pacino steals the thunder out from under Brando; nonetheless, Brando&#39;s role is perhaps the most iconic role in all of cinema. His character, styled after real life mobster Frank Costello, is one of the films many highlights.<br/><br/>Despite an unmistakable missed punch, a few continuity issues, and an abundance of character roles to keep straight, The Godfather remains one of the most influential films in cinematic history. Not only will Brando&#39;s husky whisper continue to be copied for generations to come, but also the only fruit that shares its name with its color will always signify an impending death or violent incident.<br/><br/>Aside from all of the orange metaphors, The Godfather&#39;s resounding themes on the duality of man  love and hate, good and evil, loyalty and betrayal, and family and violence  allow it to emit an atmosphere like no other film. The Godfather is the utter embodiment of the ultimate &quot;guy film&quot;, yet whether you are a male or female or a frequent or infrequent moviegoer is not dependent on how much appeal you will hold towards this first-rate pulp crime drama. Regardless of your status, you will be taken aback by its magnificence.<br/><br/>On The Internet Movie Database&#39;s website, The Godfather is listed as the number one favorite movie of all time, and on The American Film Institute&#39;s chart of the &quot;100 Years100 Movies,&quot; it is listed as the number three greatest film. First or third, there is no question why The Godfather holds a spot on a myriad of Top 10 lists, mine included. It is a seminal classic that will only continue to steamroll sovereignty, praise, and admiration."
3848,tt0068646,The Godfather,"What a movie this is? Like a ride and a half. Only coming to view it again last year, after last seeing it, I&#39;d say, early 1990, late 89&#39; this movie I&#39;ve watched a few more times, again the other night, has grown on me. It&#39;s undoubtedly a masterpiece that deserves it&#39;s place of respect as one of the great movies of all time. Ironically the film was on GO the night after I&#39;ve video&#39;d it again. That just shows ya, what a classic this is. They don&#39;t make films like this anymore. The acting is high calibre. I loved James Caan in this as the hot headed brother who meets his demise in one of three bloody scenes, the most notably of course, that horrifyingly violent scene with the horse head, in the bed of a movie producer refuses to play ball. If you want a favor, like a wrong to be righted, talk to the Godfather, (an unparalleled performance by the late great Marlon Brando, who died penniless at 145 k&#39;s-hard to believe) can solve all your problems. Brando in this, just shows ya as in other films like Apocalypse Now, he&#39;s just the consummate actor. He must of inspired so many wannabe&#39;s. Of course the great discovery of a young talent, who soon would become an acting legend/role model, was of course Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone who when we first meet him, he&#39;s not part of his mafia family. In fact, he somewhat despises it. It&#39;s the choice he makes later on, after a near death experience with a loved one, where in his eyes, payback is warranted, even though, he quotes &quot;Never personal&quot;. He becomes one of them, after brazenly taking out a crooked cop, and the head of another mafia family, responsible for the execution on his father, Don Corleone, (Brando), a tough cookie, surviving five close shots. What resilience this guy has, proving some guys are just lucky, or hard to kill. All the emotions, Pacino shows, nervousness, agitation, as he braces himself to make his first kills, were so believably intense, not overacted, just nice, perfect even. Pacino then vacates to Sicily for a year, to wait for the heat to cool down, where he marries a Sicilian beauty. I couldn&#39;t believe Diane Keaton, always terrific, and so good (fine) in this, escaped an Academy award nomination. She was just as good as most of the excellent leads. Watching Caan kick the crap out of his sister&#39;s abusive husband, was a guilty viewing pleasure. Caan really impressed me here. I won&#39;t tell you the last scene of this movie, but it involves a big fat lie, from Pacino, when asked a one time question by Keaton, which impactfully stayed with me, where if I was Pacino, for me, answering &quot;Yes&quot;, would be an impossibility. There&#39;s some things you don&#39;t see coming in The Godfather, and the story takes different paths throughout the film. The cinematography is of course, first rate, and I love the interior shots in the Don&#39;s office, and again, here&#39;s a mafia film, that has me craving Italian. Although it&#39;s occasionally violent, most of it&#39;s pretty graphic too, oh that blood so under colored, more orangy red, flowing, it will always stand as the no one mafia film. God help us, if something of it&#39;s ilk, better&#39;s it."
4461,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I am half Italian, so I must comment on this film. It is a part of my family, it is our heritage. Almost everyone in my family owns the trilogy. They are some of the most brilliant films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola is nothing short of the most brilliant director of the century. Everyone in the cast is perfect, especially Marlon and Al. Pacino is his usual genius self. The unfolding of these characters is a story of its own. The 4 Corleone brothers are all very different. Sonny, (wonderful performance by James Caan), the hot-headed, quick tempered man, Fredo, weak and powerless, goes to Vegas to set up business, only to be brought down my Michael. Michael, the most sensible, if not accepting of his family&#39;s business, he is the most likely successor of the title. Finally, Robert Duvall (a wonderful performance as well) , as Tom the lawyer and trusted counselor to the Corleone&#39;s. Watching everyone on screen and the story of the family is nothing short if genius. Watch only if you have three hours for each movie to spare, and if you like complicated character stories. It&#39;s an offer you can&#39;t refuse."
1513,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The power of cinema at its purest and most vivid expression. Screenplay, direction, cinematography, acting, editing, it all comes in the most elevated form. Francis Ford Coppola is a craftsman, as every director and artist should be, that draws inspiration from the power of the words and of the actions of characters and provides the standard upon which all the following history of cinema relies. It&#39;s an historic work of art."
2510,tt0068646,The Godfather,"More has been reviewed of this film than any other. There is so much about this film that makes it great. The direction is top shelf as was the screenplay. The word that describes it best is &quot;authentic.&quot; The entire movie - setting, plot and especially the characters are very authentic feeling.<br/><br/>The problem I have with The Godfather is the plot; specifically the ending. Novel readers and movie watchers know that you don&#39;t just give the protagonist what he or she wants unopposed. Michael orders a hit on the heads of all five families and Mo Greene at the end while his child is being baptized to get them before they get him? This is not rewarding, I&#39;m sorry.<br/><br/>Also, there needs to be more of a twist than simple betrayal by a minor character (Tessio). A betrayal should hit the reader / watcher like a gut punch. What if Kay betrayed her husband? Would he kill her or forgive the mother of his children? What about letting the head of one of the families live so they could fight another day?<br/><br/>The most common negative comments I read are about the film being boring, however I don&#39;t agree. Godfather isn&#39;t boring but the ending, even though dramatic with all the killings, is boringand unsatisfying from a plot perspective.<br/><br/>Lastly, structurally it is best to have the protagonist duel it out with the antagonist at the end. Instead, Michael doesn&#39;t get his pinky dirty while everyone else gets bloody.<br/><br/>So there you have it. Very good film but not excellent. The ending is lazy.<br/><br/>Note, I agree with Copolla about the book. While it was good it wasn&#39;t great."
771,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made- personally I just can&#39;t see the appeal. Sure it contains very good performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been other, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn&#39;t been seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the popularity? It&#39;s a formulaic feel-good movie who&#39;s happy ending is never in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway. As with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two, though the film does, on this occasion, improve on the book.<br/><br/>There have been better adaptations of King novels (The Shining) and better performances by better actors, yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually is."
2341,tt0068646,The Godfather,"****<br/><br/>Starring: Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Robert Duvall.<br/><br/>This film follows the Mafia life of the Corleone family.  When the Don gets wounded critically, the son, who has never been in the &quot;family business&quot; before, must help his family out.  The Academy made the right decision, honoring this fantastic film with all the awards it deserves.  This is DEFINITELY one of the greatest movies of all time."
3302,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This film leaves one big question behind: Why the hell is it rated no.1 in IMDb?? There is no basic storyline, sometimes some people are being murdered but nobody knows why, you can&#39;t even say if the acting is good or bad because they run around with hats and sad faces all the time. <br/><br/>From the beginning you simply sit there, waiting for some kind of message or at least some sense - and then after a much too long time the film is over. Why did they kill Don&#39;s friend? Why did they try to kill Don? Why did their enemies know that his son was driving to the husband of his sister? Where from did they know the one of the sons was in Italy? Why do they kill all the time at all? And where is the police I was wondering all the film. Lots and lots of murders, no police. Hm. It&#39;s nothing more than a bad 70&#39;s Mafia-trash-film."
4645,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I can&#39;t believe that I wasted my life on this crap. My dog, Sonny, died yesterday because I made him sit through this flaming pile of horse excrement. He ended up hijacking a semi and driving it into the Grand Canyon. I sniffed the T.V. while this was playing, and lemme tell you, it smelled like freaking&#39; turds!!! If I ever saw this movie again, I would have to do things that will have me killed in every country to the filmmakers, actors, actresses, animals and trees associated with this rotten Indian food covered in bird feathers.<br/><br/>Once, I had a drink of water. The water had a worm in it. I didn&#39;t know that at the time...Now back to the review.<br/><br/>I missed that worm, he crawled out of me like that creature from the movie &quot;Alien&quot;. The doctors said I was gonna die. I guess I showed them... They will learn the true meaning of suffering. They will feel the wrath of Bob the Worm!!!!!! Anyway, the Godfather killed my dog, so therefore, it sucks donkey poop. Peace, it sucks. 1/10"

Throughout the movie he was just majestic as Vito Corleone.The movie deals with gangwars in the best of ways without showcasing much bloodshed..The slowly picksup its pace without ever falling into too much pace and confusion...It is a well crafted movie...Hatsoff to the Director and the ensemble starcast.."
2801,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Visuals, story, acting, directing, musics... this is basically the maximum directors can reach. shawshank redemption is a great movie but it&#39;s lacking in many such as visuals. If I meet an alien and they ask me what&#39;s the best movie you guys ever made, I would give them this and say second one is almost as good as the first one."
1226,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Really great movie which teaches us to be patient and try our best !<br/><br/>It is a masterpiece of storytelling that dives into themes of hope, redemption, and the resilience of the human spirit. The film follows Andy, a banker sentenced to life in Shawshank prison for a crime he didn&#39;t commit. Through his friendship with Red, a fellow inmate, Andy brings small but profound changes to the prison, showing how kindness and perseverance can endure even in the darkest places. The story&#39;s powerful message and brilliant performances make it both emotionally moving and unforgettable-a true testament to the triumph of hope."
1945,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I don&#39;t see why this is supposed to be one of the greatest films of all time. I think this is just another one of those cases where everyone&#39;s convinced themselves it&#39;s so great only because the pretentious critics told us it is, and you&#39;re so afraid of being considered a philistine that you go along with it, telling yourself, yeah, this really is a masterpiece, even though you were bored by it too.<br/><br/>The movie&#39;s pretty boring. None of the characters are likeable. All the big moments of the movie build up to nothing more than &quot;Let&#39;s shoot him&quot; and then they do. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all that keeps happening throughout the movie, in between long drawn out dialogue scenes. And the story&#39;s not even told very well - so many long conversations that don&#39;t really convey anything of any significance; so much pointless stuff happens that doesn&#39;t really add to anything to the plot.<br/><br/>The movie dumps like 20 characters onto us all at once at the wedding scene at the beginning of the movie and then expects us to keep up with which Italian guy is which for the rest of the 3 hours. I constantly had to pause it to search on the Internet for their names to figure out who they&#39;re talking about, which ones are Al Pacino&#39;s brothers, which of them are family, which are his in-laws, who is not related to the family, who works for the old man, who works for the rival families, etc.<br/><br/>I&#39;ll give this film 1/10, not because it&#39;s quite that bad, but because it&#39;s been severely overrated and deserves to drop down a few stars.<br/><br/>The one good thing here is the music is good, I&#39;ll give it that."
4369,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Undoubtedly the best picture of all times and perhaps the only movie without a plot hole in the history of film making. Not a single scene or a line is unnecessary in the whole film. The direction, casting, plot, music, cinematography, acting, lines, everything seems just perfect. Al Paccino and Brando simply were born for their roles. But please don&#39;t bother to watch this epic film if you do like movies with extreme violence, sense less killing, unnecessary car chases and the hero fighting ten people at a time with bare hands. This film is totally in a different league, you simply cannot compare it to any other crime or gangster movie ever made. The way Al Paccino transformed himself from a subtle, educated and sophisticated Italian American into a typical Italian mafia boss, is without a doubt one of the best performances of all times."
512,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I&#39;m a 290 pound, mean-looking dude, but I cried like a baby watching this movie.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece in American story telling.<br/><br/>Every scene builds up the tension.<br/><br/>Every dialog adds depth.<br/><br/>Every central character makes sense.<br/><br/>The ending makes you smile.<br/><br/>Tim Robbins&#39; and Morgan Freemans acting is simply outstanding. Throughout the movie, you feel you get to know their inner thoughts, their longings, their fears. <br/><br/>FANTASTIC! MARVELOUS! INGENIOUS!"
3973,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is one of that movies that has something &quot;out of print&quot;. It seduces you from the beginning &#39;till the end. It has very many pluses from the background atmosphere to the characters construction. Marlon Brando he is obviously one of the best actors of all time. He is the type of actor that was epic for his time and if he could somehow appear in our days he will definitely rule. With only $286 million at box office, the movie was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. Others with big contribution has Francis Ford Coppola(director), Mario Puzo(screenwriter), Al Pacino(actor) and Robert Duvall(actor)."
3816,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Godfather amazing movie , i am 19 years old and i so much like this movie, with absolutely the best actor Marlon Brando !

2491,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Such a complex story, beautifully executed and each and every characters done their job remarkably well. Well acted, well directed, well scripted- basically anything good you can say about a movie can relate to The Godfather.
What makes this film so great is how it develops such a complex character (Michael). He starts out as a war hero, reluctant to head his father&#39;s crime empire. Then his father is attacked and just barely survives causing Michael to kill the two men responsible. He runs away to Sicily and marries a woman who is later killed and Michael goes back to America and take up his fathers position as the don of the Corleone crime family. He ultimately sends assassins to kill all of the dons of the other syndicates, completing his descent to an evil gangster. Let us also not forget the ending. Well actually I could go on and on about the baptism scene and the last 5 minutes, so just watch the clips on YouTube (or watch the entire movie). This is my all time favorite film. The sequel is also one of the greatest films of all time. 5/5 stars."
2535,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is one of the rare movie which makes us sympathize the evil. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gives out the steam of a real mafia Don. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): &quot;Don&#39;t ever take sides against the family.&quot; Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Never before have we seen performances so stellar, by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and everyone else! The Godfather has little life lessons everywhere. Along with an engaging plot, that just completes the most critically acclaimed film of all time. The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s masterpiece."
5112,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;The Godfather,&quot; directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an iconic American crime film that has captivated audiences for decades since its release in 1972. Based on Mario Puzo&#39;s best-selling novel of the same name, this epic masterpiece has stood the test of time as one of the greatest films in cinematic history. With its compelling storytelling, memorable characters, and powerful performances, &quot;The Godfather&quot; has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema, earning critical acclaim and a devoted fan base.<br/><br/>At the heart of &quot;The Godfather&quot; is the Corleone crime family, led by the patriarch Vito Corleone, played brilliantly by Marlon Brando. Brando&#39;s portrayal of the Don is nothing short of mesmerizing, as he exudes a commanding presence, effortlessly commanding respect and fear from those around him. Brando&#39;s nuanced performance brings depth and complexity to the character, showcasing the inner struggles and conflicts of a man torn between family loyalty and the violent world of organized crime.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Puzo, is a masterclass in storytelling. The plot unfolds with meticulous precision, drawing audiences into the Corleone family&#39;s world and the intricacies of their dealings. The story is rich with themes of family, power, honor, and morality, and the screenplay skillfully weaves these elements together to create a compelling narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.<br/><br/>&quot;The Godfather&quot; boasts an exceptional ensemble cast, with standout performances from its talented cast members. Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone, Vito&#39;s youngest son, who is thrust into the world of crime and undergoes a transformation from a war hero to a ruthless mobster. Pacino&#39;s portrayal of Michael is a tour de force, capturing the character&#39;s internal struggles and conflicting emotions with subtlety and intensity. James Caan as Sonny, John Cazale as Fredo, and Talia Shire as Connie all deliver powerful performances, adding depth and complexity to the Corleone family dynamics.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s cinematography, by Gordon Willis, is nothing short of breathtaking. Willis&#39;s use of lighting and shadows creates a visually stunning film that adds to the film&#39;s dark and moody atmosphere. The film&#39;s iconic shots, such as the opening scene with the puppeteer&#39;s strings and the famous &quot;baptism montage,&quot; are visually striking and have become iconic moments in cinema history.<br/><br/>&quot;The Godfather&quot; is not only a crime drama but also a character-driven film that delves into the psyche of its characters. Coppola&#39;s direction is masterful, creating a rich and immersive world that draws viewers into the story. His attention to detail and ability to capture the nuances of human behavior make for a film that feels authentic and real, despite its fictional nature.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s score, composed by Nino Rota, is another standout element of &quot;The Godfather.&quot; The hauntingly beautiful theme music, with its iconic trumpet melody, has become instantly recognizable and synonymous with the film. The score adds depth and emotion to the story, heightening the tension and drama of each scene."
397,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This movie offers less in terms of plot twists, character development and acting than what I think people realise. Morgan Freeman delivers a characteristically mundane performance and the other characters dance forgettably around him.<br/><br/>There are few to no memorable quotes and even less action, and the only real twist, at the end, could be the most overrated twist of all time.<br/><br/>I only watched this after it was deemed a must by most of my close peers and fellow movie critics, only to be gravely disappointed with their judgments. If this movie has taught me anything, it is that IMDb ratings mean jack and that people are, in general, conformist in nature ; they rate movies highly if their fellow humans talk it up. Who could forget the terrible acting and the sexual innuendos in this movie? The only reason that the director put that in there was to make it feel more prison like, but for me it felt as if he was trying to plug a bathtub with a million holes. A tub full of vomit to begin with.<br/><br/>Frankly, I do not care if this is an unpopular view. And neither should you. Popularity is a reflection of the current state of society&#39;s desires, nothing more."
224,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"In recent years the IMDB top 250 movies has had THE GODFATHER at number 1 while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number 2 . The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high <br/><br/>!!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!<br/><br/>What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe that`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s about half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? <br/><br/>Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism ) but both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who`s black ? <br/><br/>There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s score<br/><br/>I gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by IMDB voters"
3869,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Yes yes, this movie is a fundamental classic, an epic piece, a masterstroke from Coppolla, Brando, Pacino, etc. But is it really the best movie ever? Well, that&#39;s how I interpret the fact it has been on the top of IMDb since I&#39;ve looked in here for the first time. What makes it so flawless, what contributes to its eternal shining, blah blah. Maybe it&#39;s high time for a change, I&#39;m sure a lot of cult classics have been released since The Godfather has been released. Oh well...<br/><br/>I don&#39;t like The Godfather. I simply don&#39;t feel this movie. Yes it&#39;s gloomy, yes it&#39;s about mafia&#39;s dirty deeds, and oh yes it&#39;s about being a part of a family. And of course it&#39;s about Kleenex in Marlon&#39;s mouth, and Pacino&#39;s hands kissed by sad Italians. However I have a feeling that this movie has spawned a countless number of mafia movies, recycling the same themes and Robert De Niro, and furthermore movies like 60 Seconds or Ronin or The Italian Job, which are merely about how cool is it to be a gangster. Which I hate, obviously."
576,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,One interesting thing about this movie is how quickly it seems to pass.  The movie could have continued this story for another 2 or 3 hours and I don&#39;t think it would have lost my interest.  I think just because normal people like this movie is no reason to lower its rating with the &#39;movie critics&#39;. The best movie ever???  Definitely.  Everything else pales in comparison.

It has got 9.2/10 rating on IMDb and 100% on Rotten tomatoes which is the greatest rating movie and it fully deserves it!!!!!
2596,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&#39;The Godfather&#39; is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse&#39;s severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It&#39;s one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I&#39;ve seen much better films that &#39;The Godfather&#39;, and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film."
4388,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is one of the best movie of all times, with it&#39;s style, structure, and playing characters it definitely leaves a mark in a memory. <br/><br/>The movie brings us to the times, where New York City was so criminal, and Italian Mafias were spreading across that region. <br/><br/>It is the superb movie, to watch if you would like to learn a lot about Italian culture, and how the Godfather - Don Carleone took care of his business, money, people, and criminal world, and who had, a good heart, at the end of the day. The scenes take place in both Italy and Little Italy, New York City, USA!<br/><br/>Thanks."
1960,tt0068646,The Godfather,"There&#39;s a reason this film continues to top the charts as being the best film ever made. Even for it&#39;s time, the writing, acting and direction were great. I often forget when this film was made as I&#39;m watching it as the piece is timeless.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re into a stark, gritty and poignant mafia crime series, The Godfather is for you. (Surely you&#39;ve been living under a rock if you haven&#39;t seen it by now?!) Al Pacino, James Caan and of course, Marlon Brando do stellar jobs under the direction of the eminent director Francis Ford Coppola. I think I&#39;ve watched this a hundred times. No mafia film has managed to beat it!"
3142,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Call me crazy, call me whatever, but I simply didn&#39;t get the movie. I think I know the reason why. After seeing 1000s of rip-offs and the motives inside this movie explored to the death in countless movies since the 70s, the initial hand-kissing scene looks pretty trite. Or the making an offer you can&#39;t refuse? Puhleeze! <br/><br/>The movie is quite slow. I know it is all about the atmosphere, but it really is nothing special. Neither does the mumbling of Marlon Brando convey any special significance to me. Yes, he is remorseful for being a powerful leader of a criminal empire and assigning this fate to his son. Boo hoo hoo. If you don&#39;t become a crook you don&#39;t have these kinds of problems. And yes, we all get it. The aggressive son is doomed to be killed in retaliation, the ineffectual son is doomed to remain in the shadows and the resourceful son is destined to take over the &quot;family business&quot;. He simply kills off his adversaries without it ever being made clear how he outsmarted them or why no one ever came for him in a similar fashion. He actually turns into quite a ruthless son-of-a-... <br/><br/>But there is something more fundamental about why the movie isn&#39;t &quot;doing anything&quot; for me. The entire notion of &quot;honor&quot; and &quot;chivalry&quot; among criminals. It&#39;s completely fake. Now that America is mostly out of the grip of such people (not so in my own country I&#39;m afraid, but still far from Chicago of the 20s) glorifying them is easy. The truth however is quite different. Criminals usually talk of honor, but their actions are based on much baser things. And they always have an excuse for why they ended up being crooks. Don&#39;t get suckered into believing movies like these convey any truth. <br/><br/>Rating 5/10<br/><br/>Scale: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK, 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre, 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE"

The Shawshark Redemption also reflect society problems. The plots and actors played very well that make me wanted to continue watch. They are very professional as a director and actor. they capture and identify with America male spirit as it shows in movie. The story is even more interesting seeing red and Andy building a relationship in a prison. Scenes are very good. Overall, this is a fantastic film.Comparing this kind of movie with other type of movie like comedy,I recommended every movie lover to watch this or you will be missing one of the best film."
951,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore&#39;s portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising &quot;twist&quot; near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you&#39;ll want to see this one more than once."

189,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"It is the most basic of all principles of film-making: A story of redemption. This time the story is set inside Shawshank Prison, where successful banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to during the 40s, after being falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The jail veteran, Red (Morgan Freeman), sees Andy being forced through the front gates of the jail on his first day of arrival and sees him as a weakling. Red even makes a bet with the fellow inmates that he won&#39;t last. He&#39;s wrong.<br/><br/>Andy does last, and becomes an inspiration to all of those behind bars. The warden of the jail, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), is intent on bringing down Andy and his defiant nature, as all villains always are.<br/><br/>That is the prevailing message, I suppose. The redemption comes two-fold -- Andy is given time to reflect upon his life in Shawshank, and Red (who is obviously deeply moved by Andy&#39;s influence) learns a thing or two, going through a cleansing process. We see the gradual change, too -- first Red is the cynical veteran, then the curious insider, then the close friend, then the surprised object of redemption. As strange a title it may be, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is a worthy one.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, &quot;Shawshank&quot; is a good film - but far from a perfect one. I&#39;m not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement with my review (as countless others have done), but the fact that it has been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how universal its appeal is: it&#39;s about as likable and mass-marketed as possible. There&#39;s nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn&#39;t take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences -- it plays it safe, and in my opinion, a bit too safe. The film&#39;s message of hope and redemption is way too heavy-handed, the outcome being a movie that is very simple and easy to digest -- but not really very interesting beyond its surface. It speaks volumes that so many people who have gone through depression often reference this as one of the aids they used for comfort -- it&#39;s a movie that pats people on the back and gives them hope and inspiration. <br/><br/>That&#39;s a great message, but if you provide it without any challenge to the audience -- and instead just spoon feed it -- well, for me, anyway, it doesn&#39;t leave much of an impact. It&#39;s just a well-made but manipulative and self-important film."

5011,tt0068646,The Godfather,". . . why this movie gets such high ratings. It&#39;s a great story, but Coppola&#39;s criminal lack of attention to detail and continuity is insulting and Talia Shire&#39;s, James Caan&#39;s, Marlon Brando&#39;s and Diane Keaton&#39;s amateurish performances are distracting and laughable. Neither of them can act at all. Watch it again and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree."
4141,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a 1972 crime drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola that tells the story of the Corleone crime family, a powerful and influential mafia clan in New York City. The film follows the patriarch of the family, Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando), as he navigates the complex and dangerous world of organized crime, and it explores themes of family, loyalty, and the human condition.<br/><br/>One of the standout features of The Godfather is its portrayal of the complex and multi-layered relationships within the Corleone family. The film is a nuanced exploration of the dynamics of family and the ways in which people connect and disconnect with one another, and it is a thought-provoking and emotional portrayal of the human experience.<br/><br/>The acting in The Godfather is superb, with standout performances from Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and Robert De Niro as his son, Michael. Brando&#39;s portrayal of Vito is iconic and unforgettable, and De Niro&#39;s performance is both powerful and nuanced. The cinematography is also excellent, with beautiful shots that perfectly capture the mood and tone of the film. The Godfather is a classic and iconic film that is not to be missed. It is a powerful exploration of family and the human condition, and it is also a thrilling and suspenseful crime drama."
2834,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is an iconic movie about a young man taking over the crime family, it&#39;s a beautifully executed film about depravity, suffering and desperation.<br/><br/>The pacing is quite thoughtful and despite the long runtime it never really feels dull. The actors bring their A-game here and the main characters are quite well written. Visually it looks very good for the time though some scenes are a bit stiff. The tension the writers are able to portray is masterful and the dialogue is meaningful.<br/><br/>Some scenes cut too quickly to each other and it can feel very disorienting, especially when it concerns a time jump. The movie is perhaps a little too long and could benefit from a few scenes being shortened.<br/><br/>Overall The Godfather is a classic for a reason it&#39;s a thought-provoking drama with excellent tension and twists. It&#39;s overrated for sure but that doesn&#39;t stop it from being a masterpiece of the time."
5592,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;The Godfather&quot; is more than a movie; it&#39;s a cultural touchstone. It has influenced countless filmmakers, spawning a legacy that extends far beyond its own runtime. As a 38-year-old movie lover, I can confidently say that &quot;The Godfather&quot; remains a timeless masterpiece that continues to inspire and resonate with each viewing. If you haven&#39;t experienced this cinematic gem yet, it&#39;s high time you did. It&#39;s not just a film; it&#39;s an unforgettable journey into the heart of darkness and the human soul.<br/><br/>What truly sets &quot;The Godfather&quot; apart is its ability to transcend its crime drama label. It&#39;s not merely a story about gangsters; it&#39;s a meditation on power, morality, and the American dream. It challenges our notions of right and wrong, blurring the lines between hero and antihero. The film&#39;s universal themes make it accessible and relatable to audiences of all backgrounds and generations."
2746,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies enjambé off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can&#39;t. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.<br/><br/>The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.<br/><br/>The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.<br/><br/>The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
4411,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I had a rough time watching The Godfather, because all the universal acclaim was completely clouding my judgement on the movie, because instead of being able to watch the movie with clarity, all this time I was looking at the opinions of the general public as the basis of finding clear reasons why to like this movie. I know everyone praises the performances, the film&#39;s structure, and every subtle nuance, but listening to those opinions gave me the idea I should be looking at these details so I will see why this movie is so great.<br/><br/>But to my realization, I wasn&#39;t trying to find any qualities that I, MYSELF, would love about the movie. I was too busy trying to find the details of what other people liked. I was watching based on the details other people hyped up too much. That&#39;s why I have to say, you have to watch The Godfather and put the hype completely behind you and just watch it for what it is just how you would any other movie. If you develop a true opinion of the movie, not based on the hype, then that&#39;s what really matters, whether you love it or hate it.<br/><br/>I ended up watching The Godfather for the umpteenth time. Now, before this point I really didn&#39;t have an opinion on the movie. I honestly felt it was bland and didn&#39;t give me that sense of urgency a lot of my favorite movies give me, but I didn&#39;t hate it, but I also didn&#39;t love it. But this time, it clicked somehow. I enjoyed it, oddly. I honestly found a certain quality that is very hard to create in films.<br/><br/>And that certain detail is how beautiful this movie is. Behind all the murders and the brooding feel of the film, there is a lot of beauty. It&#39;s atmosphere is something that contrasts so heavily with its dark plot. And not only visually, but this is also evident in the execution of the acting performances, and the mood of the story. After watching Apocalypse Now and The Godfather II, I finally started to understood Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s style of storytelling. Despite The Godfather being a gangster film, it&#39;s very subtle and does not have any melodrama. I feel this is something people cannot get past, because with its legacy as a movie, they expect it to be something more in-your-face that will give you an emotional hit-in-the-gut feeling, but to one&#39;s realization, he or she will realize it is not those things.<br/><br/>I mean there is a beautiful score, but it too is very subtle. The movie actually benefits from silence and just let the characters most of the time direct the emotion of the plot. When watching this, I cannot believe how the actors were able to execute this difficult-to-accomplish feat. If you were to tell me how I would expect one of the best ever movies to come off as, I would&#39;ve given you a narrow-minded answer. Now I realize how much film is just as open-ended as music. We cannot just experience or enjoy an album or a film one time and expecting to gain that satisfaction thinking we know it from the inside out. If we watch a movie a second time, we can discover subtle nuances that weren&#39;t obvious in the first viewing, almost as if we&#39;re watching it from a completely different angle. And that&#39;s the beauty of i Despite how subtle The Godfather is, it really is a sophisticated film with repeated viewings. Is The Godfather my favorite movie of all time? I don&#39;t even know if I have one particular favorite, but I would place it in my top ten along with Citizen Kane. My advice would be to find certain qualities that YOU would like about The Godfather and not to base it on the opinions of people telling you what is so awesome about it, because film is more open-ended than that to build expectations. We all have things that we personally love. What is the best thing about the movie? For you or anyone else, it could be the acting, the story, the settings, or some subtle nuance that everyone is ignorant of. I personally love the mystical feel of the atmosphere and I think that is better than telling someone its the best movie ever just because it is. I like to listen to personal opinion, because of the individuality aspect to it. And The Godfather is way more rewarding if you watch it as an individual and judge it on your principles of what makes a good film and not to trust someone else&#39;s certainty that is the best movie ever. It&#39;s okay if you still don&#39;t like the movie, but what is crucial is you give complete clarity in forming an opinion that is completely your own based on what is important to you, most of all. I don&#39;t see what other film lovers see in The Godfather, I only see what I love about it."
1289,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films that captures the essence of the human spirit in a way that stays with you long after the credits roll. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King&#39;s novella, it beautifully tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man wrongfully imprisoned, and his journey through despair and, ultimately, hope.<br/><br/>What makes Shawshank extraordinary is its deep exploration of friendship, freedom, and resilience. Morgan Freeman&#39;s portrayal of &quot;Red&quot; is simply iconic, bringing wisdom and warmth to every scene. Together, Robbins and Freeman create a chemistry that feels real and grounded, adding a profound emotional layer to the film.<br/><br/>The pacing is steady, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the prison world and understand the bonds that form there. Darabont&#39;s direction and the screenplay manage to make the film&#39;s 142-minute runtime feel essential; there is no filler, only scenes that add depth and meaning to the narrative.<br/><br/>The cinematography captures both the bleakness and beauty of the Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman&#39;s score is haunting and unforgettable. The themes of hope, redemption, and perseverance resonate universally, making The Shawshank Redemption not just a story about prison life but about life itself.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film is a testament to the enduring power of hope and friendship. Even though it&#39;s over two decades old, it remains relevant and moving, proving that a story well told can truly be timeless. It&#39;s no wonder that it&#39;s regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10."
3866,tt0068646,The Godfather,"A fine movie about the mafia in the day really have its advantages. They say that blood is thicker than water, that is no joke. Mario Puzo&#39;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a real masterpiece of fine art and work of generations of mobsters. Marlon Brando does a spectacular job playing Don Vito Corleone. This mob boss doesn&#39;t play around, even though he has a bull&#39;s eye painted on him. My mom has seen this movie before I came to the world, and I had to see it first on my own time, and she was right, it is good. The real kicker is when that mobster had one of his Clydedale&#39;s head in his bed, and freaks out indefinitely. That scene is a classic, makes a horror movie look corny. And that scene where &quot;The Turk&quot;(Al Lettieri) gets pumped in a restaurant, amazing! The ambushing, the seduction, and the loyalty turn to double-cross is all there in this movie. I know this is long, but it&#39;ll be worth your while. I adore great work despite all the violence. The cast is great, and if read the book, or any of his books, consider yourself loyal. Rating 5 stars!"

Francis Lord Coppola creating the definitive master piece. The master piece of master pieces, executing everything as perfectly as it ever something was excecuted."
88,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,I have never watched a better movie than this before
22,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a &quot;Rocky&quot;-type feel-good movie that doesn&#39;t really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don&#39;t get me wrong--it&#39;s a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it&#39;s just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.<br/><br/>I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn&#39;t a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can&#39;t live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There&#39;s really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn&#39;t really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).<br/><br/>If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick&#39;s _A Clockwork Orange_.<br/><br/>I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the warden: doesn&#39;t he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.<br/><br/>I&#39;m not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it."
1867,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is the greatest movie ever made. It not only gives an interesting view on the mafia, but it teaches many valuable lessons and ideas, for which a good example is in the first scene, the meeting between the Don and Bonasera (&quot;What did I ever do to deserve such disrespect?&quot;). I am 13 now, and the first time I saw this movie was when I was 8. The Godfather has definitely made me smarter and prepared me for the independence of being a teenager. I would recommend if your child is 8+ and has not seen this movie that they watch it right away. I have the full box set, and have seen them all numerous times. The third was disappointing though, with dry acting, repetitive plot, and many awkward moments between Sofia Coppola and Al Pacino. I was also glad that the first two movies did not have too much violence, although there is a fair amount of Thompson guns in them. I have a habit of quoting Brando, who plays a character who delivers some of the most powerful, meaningful lines in any movie I have seen. I have seen most of Brando&#39;s movies, from Streetcar to Missouri breaks to the Freshman, in which his lines are so unique and unconventionally spoken they sometimes make me laugh. It was a true shame for Brando to die at the not-too-old age of 80, although he was not in good health at the time. Although many people are sure to claim the fame that Brando accomplished, I will always remember him to be the greatest actor ever."

There is a wedding scene that seems to go forever and I just don&#39;t care. This may well be peak of filmmaking but I just don&#39;t see it."
3701,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Speechless
What a Movie
These movies are handmade with dedication"
2219,tt0068646,The Godfather,"As the title says, this is maybe an obvious statement and boring pick to call my favorite movie of all time, and maybe sometimes it isn&#39;t and I say it because it&#39;s an easy title that people know. That being said, if it is or if it isn&#39;t my favorite, it is still, in my opinion, a perfect film.<br/><br/>Beautifully directed, gorgeous cinematography, excellent set pieces for such a relatively small budget, and expertly acted by some of the greatest to ever act (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton), this is easily Francis Ford Coppolla&#39;s magnum opus, even with his fantastic filmography considered."
2134,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Terrible, boring, slow, long, weird. It felt like it dragged on forever with scenes that were disgusting but not even scary or dramatic-just cheap shock for no reason. The whole thing felt pointless and empty, as if it had no story, no creativity. The characters were dull and uninteresting, with no real development or purpose. The acting was flat and uninspired, making it even more of a chore to watch. Visually, it was unremarkable, with no standout scenes or moments. The film seemed like it was trying too hard but failed to be memorable or meaningful in any way. It&#39;s also extremely overrated-people praise it faaaaaar more than it deserves, and I can&#39;t understand why. Just a complete waste of time that left me feeling frustrated and disappointed, totally not recommending it to anyone at all."
4959,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I can&#39;t count the times I&#39;ve seen the Godfather. I can&#39;t count the times I&#39;ve read books about the movie. I can&#39;t say how much I regret not having found the time to read Mario Puzo&#39;s book. The Godfather is a story about a king and his three sons. And the sons all fight for power one way or another. The succession of the kingdom is the absolute reward for some and the absolute curse for others. There is something utterly seductive about the lighting of the movie, the stories (from the main stories to the secondary characters), about the ongoing feeling that danger lies around the corner, that this life is never safe and that you must, as popular Italian culture suggests, do everything for the family. &quot;In my youngest and more vulnerable years&quot; I wrote an essay about the role/position of women in the Godfather. I wrote about the flaws of the Godfather, about how, because it was filmed from the side of the family, you couldn&#39;t see the illegitimate character of the Corleone family&#39;s work. I wrote about the misogynist approaches and the utterly patriarchal viewpoints of the movie. I wrote about the inherent racism towards other ethnic minorities. But I still can&#39;t escape the spell. I still can&#39;t believe this feeling when Michael goes to the hospital to see Vito and he protects his father as is in his imaginative nature. There are so many moments in the Godfather that make me shiver. There&#39;s so much magic in the trilogy.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t give this movie a 10, because I am a perfectionist."
2565,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I was finally forced to watch this &#39;masterpiece&#39;.  What, exactly, is the redeeming feature of this movie that all these film &#39;elites&#39; love so much.<br/><br/>It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story?  Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.<br/><br/>This movie has no business being so well-liked and shows what is wrong with both American cimema and the IMDB ranking system."
4705,tt0068646,The Godfather,Wonderful movie and one of the greatest films ever made
4774,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I&#39;m surprised by this wonderful masterpiece, the best movie in my life I&#39;ve seen. All these wonderful characters are a lot of tiredness for this long movie staff in time but it doesn&#39;t bother you. Thank you for everything."
1830,tt0068646,The Godfather,For me The Godfather is the best film. Everything from the music to acting and script are all perfect. The film has tons of amazing iconic lines and scenes and of course the character of Vito Corleone is amazing and Marlon Brando does an amazing job of playing him. Everything about the film is perfect.
2353,tt0068646,The Godfather,"When it comes to a discussion about the popularity of American cinema, it can be stated that there is hardly any American film as famous as &quot;The Godfather&quot;-a film which has caught the attention of cinema admirers all over the world. While watching the film, at first sight, viewers wouldn&#39;t lose much time to learn that the gangsters portrayed in &quot;The Godfather&quot; don&#39;t care at all for human lives as business interests come before anything else. Hence, it is perfectly normal for a man to get his brother-in-law killed as he has been disloyal to his family. It is the violent scenes of this kind which aim to terrify without being gory. From a cultural point of view, the ubiquitous discourse about American values of Italian gangsters in America make Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s film an intellectually rich viewing experience wherein there is ample spotlight on participating in family gatherings, looking well after family members and choosing to converse in English instead of Italian. Apart from the character with a crooked face- actor Marlon Brando who garners all of viewers&#39; sympathies, good performances have come from other leading players namely Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and James Caan. However, exquisite photography by veteran American cinematographer Gordon Willis and great Italian composer Nino Rota are two more reasons for watching this film about a ruthless family of criminals who left Italian shores to wreck havoc in a new land of dreams."
4719,tt0068646,The Godfather,"What an absolutely marvelous movie! Ford Coppola is truly an amazing director, and so are the entire cast of The Godfather. If it weren&#39;t for the second film of this franchise, and also Goodfellas, I would&#39;ve undoubtedly dubbed this as the best crime drama of all time.<br/><br/>The movie starts out showing the full and yet uncorrupted Corleone family, with Don Vito Corleone as the head of the family, Sonny as the hot headed underboss, Tom Hagen as the Consigliere, Fredo as the weak brother who is something between a soldier and a capo and Michael, the youngest of them all who doesn&#39;t want to walk along the path of his father. Soon enough though, internal trust issues arise in the family as multiple assasination attempts are carried out on a few family members, of which, Michael takes revenge for.<br/><br/>In an attempt to hide Michael from the ensuing drama, he is sent back to Sicily, where he finds new life and tries to start from there. But his short yet dark history follows him and he is left with nothing after going through all the things he has gone through. The innocent, brave war hero Michael is now willing to take on his father&#39;s shoes and bring the Corleone family its lost muscle and respect.<br/><br/>In this movie, we see many things that current movie crews can learn from. From using lighting to cover heavy make-up, to an absolute masterful execution of a Juxtaposition right around the end, this movie has it all. All 3 hours of it is a beautiful learning and enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Also just saying, if you&#39;re watching this with kids, there&#39;s just a few seconds of upper-body nudity here from Simonetta Stefanelli and that&#39;s about it. So if your kid is above 14-15 it should be fine."
4318,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo&#39;s novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don&#39;s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.<br/><br/>The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It&#39;s the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn&#39;t (or, at least, shouldn&#39;t) pay.<br/><br/>It still doesn&#39;t, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren&#39;t limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in."
1422,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless masterpiece about hope, resilience, and the human spirit. The friendship between Andy and Red is deeply moving, and the storytelling is flawless. Every scene is packed with emotion and meaning, building to one of the most satisfying endings in film history. It&#39;s not just a prison drama-it&#39;s a story about freedom, justice, and never giving up on life."
5384,tt0068646,The Godfather,This is one of the best movies ever made. I&#39;ve seen this and Godfather 2 over a dozen times! It&#39;s a timeless and perfect movie.
4029,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Regarded as one of the most important and influential films of the century. This film has definitely changed the way gangster films are created. Back in the golden days of cinema, gangster films were notable for their violence and profanity. The Godfather changed the way contemporary gangster or crime films are approached. I don&#39;t want the review of this film be based on the film&#39;s impact but rather focusing on the film on its own.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s story is based on a novel by Mario Puzo and written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola. Puzo&#39;s novel has been, before the film, has been a commercial and critical hit. I have not read Puzo&#39;s novel but Coppola&#39;s writing for this film is definitely entertaining. The film may have metaphors and deep layered themes but to me, it wasn&#39;t something I was looking for, as the story of this family is so damn entertaining that it did not need to be layered to be interesting. The strongest areas of this film focuses on the structure and functioning of the family business. The film also depicts the rise of Michael Corleone and how different he becomes when he becomes involved in the business he never wanted to be in the first place.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola has created the most acclaimed films of all time and all seem to be confined in the decade of the 70&#39;s. Each one of those films, aside from the Godfather sequel, is completely different from one another and at least one will appeal to a person. Coppola focused a lot on the culture and family aspect of this film which made this something unique. Though different from previous gangster films, it did not sacrifice on the areas that makes it exciting like the violence and tension. It still focuses on the competing families and the betrayal that is familiar in the genre. Brilliant direction has allowed every scene to be important in driving the story, there is no scene that does not drive anything for either the characters or the plot.<br/><br/>Gordon Willis&#39; cinematography feels like a picture or a video from an old camera that has aged. The film is dominated by a golden hue that gives the film that feeling of age.The film successfully feels like a period film and immerses you in the time period of the 1940&#39;s. Scenes like the wedding and the baptism are breathtaking. Willis has added in the film&#39;s lasting power as there are very few films that captures a moment in time so well as what he did for The Godfather and it&#39;s sequel.<br/><br/>The film may feel slow to some people but I feel that it&#39;s important as it allows for characters to develop and the story to have more breathing room. The film is driven in detailed and intricate performances rather than spectacular and grand moments.<br/><br/>How many of you have watched this film or at the very least heard the theme and gets stuck on your head for hours after you&#39;ve heard it. As I am writing this, it&#39;s playing in my head. The score is something that would be heard in funerals or some other sad dramatic moment. The score is stays faithful to the film&#39;s cultural roots and at the same time making it something that sounds from a classic gangster films. Due to the film&#39;s score being so memorable and effective, it has become something composers of films in the same genre to go back to, in creating their scores.<br/><br/>Iconic role played by an iconic actor. Vito Corleone can never be pictured played by another actor aside from Marlon Brando. The actor has played characters that are typical from leading actors and so seeing him in a character that was definitely at least 10 to 15 years older than his own during production, was a revelation. He embodied this respected and vulnerable man, and without a doubt outshone every actor in this film. Pacino was great as Michael but I felt he shows more of his acting capabilities in the second and third film. The entire cast works well together and each performance can be labeled as their most strongest in their career.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films from Coppola. I cannot say this is his magnum opus because other films he has written and directed, Apocalypse Now and The Godfather Part II, are equally as powerful. The Godfather is an example of an amazing story, brilliantly acted and excellent direction in adapting an already iconic novel."

4489,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I personally believe that this movie is overrated. I don&#39;t really even believe it is the best work from a Coppola (I personally believe &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; are much better movies), but it still is entertaining to watch. It has notable performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino (perhaps the only Pacino performance other than &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; where he doesn&#39;t scream his eyes out), and the film also has a very nice screenplay, but the movie isn&#39;t as entertaining or extraordinary as other frontrunners like &quot;Casablanca&quot; or &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Maybe because this movie has been marred by so many rip-offs or clones, that the magic of the film has disappeared. The film just no longer feels ageless, and that&#39;s too bad."
3521,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is incredible. It&#39;s the perfect story of family combined with the mafia. This is an amazing story of how power can corrupt and change people, and perfectly blends a balance of family into the mafia life. This movie truly shows the passage of time from the old ways of Vito corleone to the present day ways that do not suit him, and overall help mold the story and craft a beautiful and incredible movie that is one that everyone should see."
72,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a &quot;Rocky&quot;-type feel-good movie that doesn&#39;t really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don&#39;t get me wrong--it&#39;s a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it&#39;s just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.<br/><br/>I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn&#39;t a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can&#39;t live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There&#39;s really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn&#39;t really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).<br/><br/>If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick&#39;s _A Clockwork Orange_.<br/><br/>I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the warden: doesn&#39;t he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.<br/><br/>I&#39;m not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it."
1519,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems &quot;too old or young for the part&quot;. Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem &quot;out of place&quot; or &quot;unconvincing&quot;. The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you&#39;ve seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS &quot;The Godfather Saga&quot; (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."
5418,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;The Godfather&quot; is an iconic masterpiece that redefined the crime genre. With its intricate narrative, unforgettable characters, and masterful direction by Francis Ford Coppola, the film delves deep into the world of the Corleone family. Marlon Brando&#39;s portrayal of Vito Corleone is legendary, and Al Pacino&#39;s transformation as Michael Corleone is compelling and powerful. The film&#39;s themes of loyalty, power, and family are explored with depth and nuance. Its cinematography, score, and screenplay are all exceptional, creating a cinematic experience that is as compelling today as it was upon its release. Truly, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a timeless classic."
5335,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One of the best master piece by &quot;Francis Ford Coppola&quot;, Desevrs the best Rating ever. It gives Marlon Brando the new name. Al Pacino as his best. Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando, whose iconic performance has overshadowed an even better turn by Al Pacino as his son Michael) is a man for whom family is all. &quot;A man who doesn&#39;t spend time with his family can never be a real man,&quot; he says, and he lives by that. He&#39;s devoted to his wife, dotes on his children and grandchildren, throws a lavish wedding for his daughter, and kills or threatens anyone who gets in his way or that of his family and friends. His sons are all in the family business, which includes union racketeering and gambling."
2557,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;The Godfather&quot; simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I&#39;ve ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I&#39;ve ever seen or will ever see. It&#39;s also one of the most precise and intricate films I&#39;ve ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching &quot;The Godfather,&quot; is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s direction is what brings this film, that&#39;s so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He&#39;s the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny&#39;s (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. <br/><br/>The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito&#39; daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, &quot;That&#39;s my family, Kay. That&#39;s not me.&quot; <br/><br/>We get the feeling that Michael&#39;s nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino&#39; role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He&#39;s the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family&#39;s actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. <br/><br/>The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He&#39;s treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader&#39;s confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can&#39;t refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino&#39; shinning moment in the film. There&#39;s no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get&#39;s upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo&#39;s height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, &quot;Fredo, don&#39;t ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.&quot;<br/><br/>That&#39;s some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael&#39;s change believable. He&#39;s not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he&#39;s capable of turning on anyone and using the line, &quot;It&#39;s strictly business&quot; when it comes to family issues. Michael&#39;s sister, Connie, calls him a &quot;cold hearted bastard&quot; at the end of the film. It&#39;s hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino&#39; performance is that he doesn&#39;t sugarcoat it. He doesn&#39;t try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That&#39;s the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let&#39;s us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like &quot;The Godfather,&quot; that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again."
4614,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I highly enjoyed this movie. Title is perfect for the context of the movie. Therefore, I rate this movie 8 stars! This American Crime film was a pleasure to watch."
4013,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Beautiful FIlm! The first time I saw him I was really surprised ... I think it is an absolute masterpiece of world cinema. I live among each other in one of the places where it was the scene of the encounter with Apollonia and subsequent marriage to Michael Corleone. It &#39;a film that appeals to all ages, however long, is full of twists and ideas more than interesting. My favorite character is Don Vito in which the wise direction of Francis Ford Coppola has allowed us to create a character that would become an icon of international cinema. I can not add anything to what has already been said to the Godfather ... I am sure that will continue to stay on top of forever, is a film that will never go out of fashion!"
1575,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In fact, visually, Copolla lets us know that Kay and Apollonia are opposites in respect to what they mean to Michael and what their relationships mean to him. As Michael is courting Apollonia, he takes her for a walk, the camera remains behind the couple and we are not privy to their conversation as they walk onward, followed by a formative collection of sisters, cousins and perhaps even Apollonia&#39;s mother. In contrast, when Michael is courting Kay, back from his long time away, he walks with her, much like he walked with Apollonia, but now the camera is in front of the couple, and we are privy to their conversation. They too have an escort following them at a discreet distance, but now it is a black car with muscle/protection."
601,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I enjoyed this the first time I saw it. But then again I was only an easily impressionable 14-year-old, craving for new emotion. Recently, more than 10 years later, I revisited it, and barely managed to finish it. Bluntly, it&#39;s as plain and trite as it gets. In fact, I believe Frank deliberately wanted it that way, so that it would increase its appeal to the casual movie goers. In general, I have no problem with a simple, feel-good movie that does not take itself too seriously and is not looking to change its audience in a profound way. However, this does and it seems it is succeeding unfortunately....<br/><br/>We have a story about hope and its redemptive qualities, portrayed by an innocent man that is sent to prison(Tim&#39;s character). It&#39;s told through the eyes of his closest prison friend(Morgan&#39;s character). The narrative framing and flow are rigid, there is no rhythm, no ebb and flow, no metaphors, no irony, just constant relentless narration - extreme simplicity. It&#39;s stripped to the point that you can only remember the generic message. Dangerous stuff. Some people carry it around and &quot;apply&quot; it diligently. The others only observe the snowball effect.<br/><br/>I hope there are more intelligent endeavors out there. I hope everyone sees them and appreciates them. I hope...<br/><br/>1/5 - Skip this, if you are over 15. There is no art here - almost no contribution to the art of filmmaking and storytelling."
4360,tt0068646,The Godfather,"People say this movie is one or even the best movie of all time I can&#39;t really understand why. I did not go in for very high expectations so I thought that after I had watched this movie my mind would be blown but it wasn&#39;t and thats really sad. This movie was really original but it doesn&#39;t and it helps this movie a lot still this movie is very overrated. I have not read the book. This movie compared to The Dark Knight Trilogy is I&#39;m sorry to say it but a joke. It&#39;s not really worth watching it feels like what was the purpose of this movie? To see the underworld? The last 15 minutes are the best thing in this movie but you really got to ask yourself is it worth watching a movie that is 175 minutes long for 15 minutes? The actors was outstanding but so are the ones in as an example The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception or Lord of The Rings Trilogy. When I was going to see Looper I came in with the same expectations but but my mind was blewn! Looper had a purpose but The Godfather didn&#39;t. Sorry to all of you who think that your going to see the best movie ever but this is not the one, go see Lord of The Rings Trilogy there you have a masterpiece!"
274,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,I can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. And this must be his best roll ever. I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film. All the prison guards and inmates were really believable. The story captures you from the beginning and doesn&#39;t let go until the final credits are rolled. This is the kind of film that make you think of how many inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears about. Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion brings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation. And that nothing is black and white. But until it effect you its out of sight and out of mind.
5424,tt0068646,The Godfather,Snoozefest deluxe. Would not recommend watching this movie.
1022,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,The plot and the actors amazed me. The ninetees clearly were the best era of movies and this one is a great example.
448,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"There are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. I have loved The Shawshank Redemption since I first saw it, but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. In short order I lost my father to illness, my wife to separation, and my career to anger and dismay. Lost in depression, mired in pain, and alone in a large house I watched it again. Between Brooks suffering, Red&#39;s hatred of hope, and Andy&#39;s response to his final isolation, I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. This movie gave me the strength to start over. The movie is popular for many reasons, but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own Shawshank."
5389,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One of the jewels in the crown of the 70s cinema, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family. Itialian immigrants, caring people, and mafioso. From the first frame in which you see Marlon Brando&#39;s face lit from in front and above like a dark angel to the last frame of the last film in which Al Pacino&#39;s wineglass falls out of his hand as he slumps, the family gone and destroyed. <br/><br/>The Godfather is the holy trinity of mob films. Every film after it has its influences in it, and, much like some people look towards the Star Wars trilogy for an answer to every question, many people do so for The Godfather."
3408,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Wow, Absolutely amazing film. A wonderful cast of actors."
4392,tt0068646,The Godfather,"My problem with The Godfather is singular. I feel absolutely nothing the entire movie. I feel no emotional connection to the characters. I feel no emotional connection to the story. Of all the gangster movies this trilogy is far behind many of the modern classics. Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed are all much better movies. They have a wow factor to them. The Godfather tries incredibly hard to get you to car about these mob families, but I just don&#39;t. I&#39;ve always thought this was a mediocre trilogy. A move should make you feel something and everytime I&#39;ve sat down to watch the Godfather the only feeling I get is boredom. It is not a 9.2..."
557,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Ok, as I give this movie a 9, it is going to be hard to be critical, but I feel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesn&#39;t rate a movie a 10.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting was sensational - as good as I have seen in a long time. The direction was great and the script was great. And, it turned into (unexpectedly) a true buddy story.<br/><br/>I could only criticize a couple things - one of which was NOT the length - 2:20. I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were extremely nice guys - except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower. I also have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones - especially early on. But, then what prison movie attempting to depict real life could leave that out???<br/><br/>Also, prison movies in the 1940&#39;s, 1950&#39;s and 1960&#39;s are not my favorite genre, however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really don&#39;t care very much what period it takes place in. Anyway, that is just personal preference.<br/><br/>All in all, it deserves the praise it gets. I&#39;m very glad I finally took the time to watch it."
227,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I quite like this film but it wouldn&#39;t make my top 100. The idea it&#39;s the greatest film in history is laughable.<br/><br/>Of course the acting&#39;s terrific. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are solid as ever, even if Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown (the Baddies) chew the scenery. And that&#39;s the problem - everything is so terribly black and white, with every character springing straight out of a three word summary. Our hero is Good But Flawed, Red is Good And Noble, the Warden is Just Plain Bad and his henchman is Reminiscent Of Another Film (okay, four words).<br/><br/>I&#39;ve never been inside a prison, but I can&#39;t believe all the prisoners would be so damn nice. There&#39;s the &quot;sisters&quot; - a bunch of horrid rapists, of course, but they&#39;re nothing a small plot contrivance can&#39;t eliminate. The &quot;sisters&quot; aside, there&#39;s nary a cross word from a prisoner in the whole film.<br/><br/>Racism is also curiously absent. American prisons today are notorious hot-beds of racism. Martin Luther King&#39;s dream is bizarrely alive and well in Shawshank, where colour doesn&#39;t get a mention in twenty years of &quot;history&quot;.<br/><br/>This total lack of realism means it&#39;s not really a film about prison at all. And what kind of &quot;character&quot; film can be centred around someone who seems entirely flawless (other than perhaps in his choice of attorney).<br/><br/>I can whinge about the mechanics of the film as well. Voiceover narration is irritating enough - but Red narrating events at which he was not present? Pur-lease. And that final scene - talk about a director who didn&#39;t know when to shout &quot;cut&quot;. It didn&#39;t need much self control to stop at the point Red heads towards Mexico - films for grown-ups shouldn&#39;t need endings that resolve any uncertainty.<br/><br/>Speaking of the director, isn&#39;t it odd how the maker of the &quot;Greatest film in the world ever&quot; is also credited for The Fan, Eraser, The Blob and The Fly II? It&#39;s as if Orson Welles directed &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, or Francis Ford Copolla helmed &quot;Megaforce&quot;.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t mean to make this out to be a bad film - it&#39;s far from that. But anyone who rates it the greatest ever should try &quot;Godfather&quot;, &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot; - something, anything that&#39;s not so *worthy*."
4768,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is excellent Melo drama of crime film. About family, social, personal of our self about what should we do for protect the family and bring a punishment for bad people, and we also must teach a bad people with kindness not with violence."
346,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,This is my favorite movie of all time. I have this movie in Physical format and I have it on digital and let me tell you that I will stop everything I&#39;m doing if I catch it on cable. This movie has stood the test of time and each watch gets better. It has an epic feel to it. Freeman and Robbins absolutely kill it in this movie. Supporting cast is on point. The music will keep you in the moment and compliments the visuals till the very end.
2847,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It is indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there, however best movie of all time i would have to say no. It does indeed deserve it&#39;s reputation as one of the best movies of all time, however based on the fact it was number 1 on the IMDb top 250 i was a tad disappointed. I was fascinated by it&#39;s very engrossing story telling, the absolutely stunning performances and the incredible direction from Francis Ford Coppola . It&#39;s a pretty powerful movie with a lot of disturbing moments. It starts of a little slow but once it gets going it never fails to grip you. The direction is Incredible. Apart from the slow beginning the direction is flawless, with an EXCELLENT pace,awesome camera work and the way the camera moved with the characters it was great!, plus he created a great atmosphere!. There is LOTS of bloody violence. We get LOTS of EXTREMELY bloody gunshot wounds, knife in the hand, bloody gunshot wound to the head,severed horse head in someone&#39;s bed (VERY bloody), a harsh beating and , an very gory gunshot wound to the eye. The Acting is some of the best i have ever seen. Marlon Brando without a doubt deserved his Oscar for his groundbreaking performance, however having said all that Al Pacino deserved the Oscar just as much, it also was hard to understand what Brando was saying at times!. Al Pacino&#39;s performance was just as good and was also deserving of The Oscar, he and Brando had some cool scenes together and watching Pacino was just plain fun to watch!. James Caan was EXCELLENT here in his scenes here and wish he had more screen time , he is a terrific actor!. Robert Duvall is very good here with what he had to do i liked him lots. Diane Keaton is excellent here as Pacino&#39;s wife and had awesome chemistry with Pacino. Talia Shire was very good here but went a little crazy at times and she sure broke a lot of dishes! (LOL, and the rest of the cast did a tremendous job as well. Overall this indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there however i was expecting a little too much and was a tad disappointed however i HIGHLY suggest you buy or rent this now just don&#39;t go in expecting it to be the best of all time (although a lot of viewers will probably think it is). ***** out of 5"
1402,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Trust me this one of the movie that u must be watched before dead. I really love the story. Thanks for stephen king!!! Good acting too. Everything about this movie so good. In fact from me this rating movie should be 9,8 :)"
3203,tt0068646,The Godfather,"A must watch for all film enthusiasts and lovers. The acting, story, the direction it&#39;s extraordinary and the movie is released in 1972 that&#39;s remarkable."
4986,tt0068646,The Godfather,"At three different occasions, i tried to watch this whole movie, this was about 4 years ago.. I don&#39;t know maybe i was too young and impatient, but at every single try i never got through it, and i wanted to get through it all because everyone loved it so much and it had good rating and reviews. A few days ago i had to watch it, the whole movie, 3 hours. At first i was thinking &quot;oh sh*t&quot;, but i just had to get it over with. <br/><br/>The performance of these two as i saw as main characters, Marlon and Pacino delivers an outstanding performance in adjusting to their characters battles as well in handling their emotions progressively. If we focus on Marlon his character i believe not many people could pull off, you can see that he really is stuck in this character, he looks worried constantly and troubled but at the same time a bit calm and bitter. His accent make&#39;s him even more interesting and the way he talks jagged tone. If we take a look at Pacino&#39;s role, I&#39;d say this is irreplaceable as well, from the beginning who is a bit innocent and tries to not get involved, but the exceptional we see further on about his character evolves to this emotionless devil. What is so fascinating about this movie is how one person behavior is changing as the person itself goes through violence, sorrow and grief, what these situations turns a person in something he least wanted in this world. But as he goes through it, it becomes like nature to him, it&#39;s like it was in his veins from the start, he just needed it the keep spreading like a disease throughout his system. This is what is so bizarre until the very end, to wonder how he got so emotionless. <br/><br/>I&#39;ve never liked movies that were all about the Mafia, because i&#39;ve never liked their motives. Which in the end it&#39;s all about money, respect and family, but this was something different."
3275,tt0068646,The Godfather,"10-10This movie is great, very good script, great casting, excellent and great acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is More than 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
2731,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando&#39;s acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It&#39;s so bad it&#39;s hilarious.<br/><br/>This movie was a classic for it&#39;s time, but give me a break I don&#39;t believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they&#39;re nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it&#39;s time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it&#39;s worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years."
2864,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola) <br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of an organised dynasty, who has an expanded family, which he loves truly. But when Don Vito is shot and ends up in hospital, control of the family business is given to his son, Michael (Pacino), who must go into hiding for the protection of himself and his father.<br/><br/>Cinematic classic which can&#39;t go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.<br/><br/>He came all the way from California. I told you he&#39;d come! - Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)"
1761,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It is amazing to see such quality of actors all in one film.  Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pacino, and John Cazale fill out one of the more impressive casts seen in modern movie making. You can just feel the intensity of the whole chain of events that happen."
3778,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is about boring and miserable people making others miserable in a boring way. I do not get why it is so highly praised. Sure great performances from every single actor and actress - but the story is just. So. Uninteresting.<br/><br/>Not once in this movie&#39;s entire runtime was I excited or curious to know what would be happening next. Because these characters cannot get you to care about their lives. They are not sympathetic enough that you&#39;d feel sad for them, nor they are evil enough that you&#39;d feel anger. They don&#39;t make you feel anything. These are emotionally suppressed people with very bland personalities - and their lives suck - but it could suck less if only they weren&#39;t overdramatic because the script required them to do so. This movie just made me mad."
527,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I can&#39;t help but feel emotional every time I see this film. Both Robbins and Freeman are excellent, and the supporting cast is good enough not to screw anything up, but they aren&#39;t spectacular. <br/><br/>One of the few complaints I have about the film is that it does get slow at times, and I find myself becoming a little bored. Another complaint I have is I wish the makers of Shawshank would give credit where credit is due for the amazing amount of scenes and ideas taken from Escape From Alcatraz, starring Clint Eastwood. How can so many critics claim that Instinct is derivative while none of them mention the fact that Shawshank Redemption is one of the most derivative movies of all time? Shawshank is significantly better than Alcatraz, and it does have important emotional elements that Alcatraz is void of; but a theft is a theft, and that won&#39;t change unless the makers of Shawshank start giving credit to Alcatraz. Here are some of the things stolen: <br/><br/>The digging tool being kept in a carved out bible and the somewhat funny irony that that entails. <br/><br/>The rapist encountering the star in the showers near the beginning of the film to set up further encounters. <br/><br/>An inmate at mealtime asking the star whether he will be eating something and then pulling out a small animal. I&#39;m sure most Shawshank lovers thought that the whole bird thing was a completely original symbolic idea. Sorry, but even though the symbolism is well taken, it was FAR from original. The whole idea probably started with the mealtime animal scene, as it was obviously a direct steal. <br/><br/>The digging debris being emptied out of the star&#39;s pants during strolls.<br/><br/>
The star befriending the black guy who can get you anything. True, Red is a much more important character in Shawshank, but considering how much was stolen, this certainly was too. <br/><br/>There are several others that I have forgotten, as I have not seen Escape from Alcatraz in quite awhile. And if Instinct had any cliché&#39;s, Shawshank certainly did, with the evil warden, the evil guard, the religion, the &quot;highly intelligent&quot; star, and the concentration on the &quot;hole&quot;, where the star is always sent to burn for a while. <br/><br/>Despite all of this, I really do like Shawshank Redemption and will probably watch it many times in the future, but it absolutely amazes me that I have not seen or heard one single critic mention the robbery here. And as people became critic-following sheep with Instinct, they certainly did with Shawshank. <br/><br/>Jeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub"
1334,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This is the best movie for those who trying to think themselves in a cage, for no reason. Also, it has got various phases where to tackle the real situation-ships like bullying and dealing with unusual people. How work as a team and ask people to join for it. It also got a tackle of people in opposite ways too. Ultimately, education is everything, where people consider each other as an animal. Now lets talk about another dimension of life philosophy that is hope, yes it has got a better way of examining and explaining the hope with hidden efforts that leads to freeing from unliked places. :3 :D."

2249,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I expected a lot of this film especially after this was ranked as one of the best films. But to give it #1 ranking is way too much. I watched it and it was an OK film. The portrayal was real but a little too slow at times. Reality they say bites and I guess it was more like a documovie that chronicles the life of a mafia and his family. Facts were not the problem here, the speed was. I could find little that was debatable or something like that, just that it made me sleep. The sequel was no better in working as a sleeping pill."
4802,tt0068646,The Godfather,Wow! One of the best crafted movies I&#39;ve ever seen! The atmosphere is just taking you back in those crazy times.. Just speechless how much I liked this film.
4124,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Rated R for Strong Violence,Sexual Content and Some Language. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18A<br/><br/>The Godfather is the number 1 movie on IMDb&#39;s Top 250 movies list.It won best picture at the academy awards.It has been praised by critics and it spawned two sequels.I don&#39;t think it should be the number 1 movie in the Top 250(dont ask me what should because I am not really sure) but Godfather is a very amazing movie and its definitely in my Top 10 movie list.This is one of the first and greatest mafia movies ever made.It has excellent acting, an excellent storyline, it is a great adaptation of a great book, it has an all star cast of Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan,Robert Duvall,Talia Shire,Diane Keaton and others.I can see why some people may not like it.I can see it being boring for some people but I find it one of the few long movies that keep me interested until the end.The movie is about a mafia don, who gets shot and this sparks a war between the five mafia families of new york.Their son Michael(Al Pacino) is an army veteran who does not want to get involved in the family business but ends up being the don(sorry about the spoiler).The movie has a great ending as well.This movie was fairly violent for 1972 but is tame by today&#39;s standards.In conclusion the godfather is an excellent mafia movie but it is a little overrated.Godfather Part 2 is almost as good, Part 3 is not as good as the first two but still good despite what most think."
2456,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In the timeless classic &quot;The Godfather,&quot; the portrayal of Michael&#39;s character development is simply breathtaking. Watching Al Pacino&#39;s transformation as he delves into the complex psyche of Michael Corleone is an absolute cinematic treat. From the very beginning, we witness a man torn between his desire to lead a respectable life and his family&#39;s ties to the underworld. As the narrative unfolds, we are drawn into the magnetic allure of his transformation, and it&#39;s almost mesmerizing to see how he evolves into a formidable figure, embracing the power and responsibility that comes with the title of &quot;Godfather.&quot;<br/><br/>Marlon Brando&#39;s portrayal of Vito Corleone is equally exceptional, showcasing the brilliance of two acting legends working in perfect harmony. Brando&#39;s commanding presence brings gravitas to the character of the family patriarch, and the emotional depth he infuses into Vito&#39;s persona is nothing short of extraordinary. The on-screen chemistry between Pacino and Brando elevates the film to unparalleled heights, making their interactions a sheer pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>&quot;The Godfather&quot; is an epic masterpiece that effortlessly captures the essence of loyalty, power, and the complexities of family dynamics. It&#39;s a captivating journey that delves deep into the human psyche, leaving viewers spellbound throughout its three-hour runtime. Surprisingly, the film never feels lengthy, as every scene is meticulously crafted to hold your attention, and you&#39;ll find yourself completely engrossed in the compelling storyline, never once glancing at your watch.<br/><br/>Beyond its cinematic brilliance, &quot;The Godfather&quot; holds a special place in the hearts of cinephiles for its iconic dialogues, unforgettable scenes, and its ability to etch indelible moments in the annals of film history. The score, the cinematography, and the direction are all masterfully orchestrated, elevating the movie to the pinnacle of cinematic achievement.<br/><br/>If you haven&#39;t experienced &quot;The Godfather&quot; yet, it&#39;s an absolute must-watch for any movie enthusiast. Its influence on cinema and popular culture is undeniable, and even after all these years, its impact remains undiminished. Prepare to be immersed in a world of power, ambition, and family as you witness the saga of the Corleone family unfold before your eyes."
3708,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Much like The Exorcist, this is a film that is praised my amateur minds, who know little about what makes a decent film. It has a few moments that brought a smile to my face, (well, one...when if finally finished). It&#39;s far, far too long, a self-indulgence that seeps into the rest of the movie. I found Brando&#39;s performance to be hammy, unconvincing and laughable, (how did a guy resembling a giant hamster control this group of poorly-acted gangsters?) Quite literally nothing of any significance occurs in this film, it&#39;s just an endless succession of mumbling, shooting, and glaring. I suppose that masochists find it entertaining, everybody else either A; Hasn&#39;t seen it, or B; Are lying. The &quot;special effects&quot; for the shooting scenes are very 1970&#39;s, ie, poor. It&#39;s no use saying this is a classic-to me, it &#39;aint, and i&#39;m somebody who KNOWS he&#39;s right!! Watch something of true class instead...though you&#39;ll be hard pushed to find anything in the crime genre."
2856,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.<br/><br/>Based on Mario Puzo&#39;s novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.<br/><br/>What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn&#39;t been said before? It&#39;s an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven&#39;t seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese&#39;s classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone&#39;s have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it&#39;s sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo&#39;s book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather&#39;s script is movie screen writing at it&#39;s very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael&#39;s mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.<br/><br/>The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino &#39;Sonny&#39; Corleone,Michael&#39;s short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone&#39;s adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael&#39;s girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito&#39;s Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.<br/><br/>The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it&#39;s best. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
5306,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Best movie ever! I think that Coppola get his capolavoro with this movie. The Pacino&#39;s transformation its one of the most inspiring creative acting works for any actor or actress that who has ever dreamed of becoming an actor. Marlon Brando&#39;s performance is truly unique it was a revelation to my life to have known his work. You can watch the movie two hundred times, it&#39;s never gonna get any worse. The way Puzo weaves the script and takes it to the awkward areas where we have to accept that we don&#39;t want Santino or the gift killed. It&#39;s an act of mastery and mastery when it comes to writing a script and identifying with a mafia boss to the point that we feel part of the family. Duvall&#39;s work is sublime."
128,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Superbly played film set in 1946 , a bright young New England banker is convicted of the slayings of his spouse and her lover and sentenced to life at a strict State Prison . Introspective and quite Andy (Tim Robbins) gradually befriends inmates and over the next 2 decades wins the trust of prisoners and wardens but in his heart he still yearns for freedom . There he forms a peculiar friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), the prison fixer , he experiences the brutality of prison life with a sadistic head guard (Clancy Brown), and is also mistreated and raped ; however , he adapts himself and offers financial advice to the guards and the selfish governor (Bob Gunton) , all in a shot 19 years. As two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding peace and redemption through acts of common help , friendship and decency . But when the proof of Andy&#39;s innocence is ripped away by those who need his services ,we learn that all is not quite what it seems at this State Penitentary , provoking a few susprises in the last two reels .<br/><br/>
This is a very good and serious prison movie with thrills , emotion , exciting scenes , colour-blind relationships , hardnut camaraderie , gang opression , and violent disavowal of any homosexual implications . Prison buffs will find a lot of incidents to relish and the great spiritual resolution takes some swallowing and unexpected surprises . Adapted from the novella ¨Rita Hayworth and Shawshank redemption¨ ; the twist here is the upright starring is exceptionally bright , as his ability with accountancy leads to his handling the finances of everyone , from the humblest guard to the prison boss . Wonderful spectacle in watching time-passer while changing the bombshell actresses of the history : Rita Hayworth , Marilyn Monroe , Raquel Welch . US prison films have been making solid fares for more than sixty years and apart from slowness of pace in the second half , this one is well up to prison standards . This Frank Darabont&#39;s theatrical debut turns out to be a throwback rendition to the kind of literate , thought-provoking prison drama Hollywood used to make , such as : I am a fugitive from a chain gang , Birdman of Alcatraz and Escape from Alcatraz .<br/><br/>Tim Robbins plays magnificently Andy , an inmate finding solace and eventual redemption , Tim provides his usual talent for playing ambiguous roles , as his notable skills are put to good use. Along with Robbins&#39; best screen acting there are various Oscar-worthy supporting characters with special mention for Morgan Freeman as the good fixer who brings his ordinary grace to what could have been a thankless role , the veteran James Withmore as the crow-keeping librarian , the sympathetic newcomer inmate Gil Bellows ,William Sadler , Mark Rolston and the ruthless guardian Clancy Brown and , of course , the egoistic and nasty governor excellently played by Bob Gunton .<br/><br/>It contains a colorful and evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins . And an enjoyable and really feeling musical score by Thomas Newman . In his engrossing direction debut ,Darabont avoids boring by fleeing most prison movie cliches . It results to be a pleasure of discovering a first-time filmmaker with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience , giving sensitive scenes , and brave enough to let roles details accumulate without recourse the excessively maudlin and over-sentimentality. It is a true masterpiece , being marvelously acted and perfectly paced."

3314,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Because this movie has Extraordinary performances, amazing direction, incredible screenplay, and an excellent soundtrack, it&#39;s more than good, more than great, it&#39;s perfection in every way. When I first saw this movie, I was 10 years old, and I couldn&#39;t stand it, and now I love it, so be patient, watch this movie and observe every detail, that will make it unforgettable.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone(Brando) is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael(Pacino) has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Tania Shire, Michael&#39;s sister) to Carlo Rizzi(Russo). All of Michael&#39;s family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo(Lettieri) is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don&#39;s lawyer Tom Hagen(Duvall), the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.<br/><br/>Everybody says that the movie gets everything right, and it&#39;s true. This movie follows a narrative rhythm that is impeccable, it never slows down too much, and that&#39;s because the whole movie is slow. And in some tense scenes (Like the scene where Michael is changing his father&#39;s room in the hospital), and even some funny ones (When Michael is in Sicily talking to a man about that girl that he met, and the guy finds out that she&#39;s his daughter), it&#39;s done with excellency.<br/><br/>The screenplay is one of the best ever made. It develops it&#39;s character so well, that almost everyone is learning something during the story. And of course, it gives us memorable quotes like the classic &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse!&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m a superstitious man!&quot;. The Soundtrack by Nino Rota is brilliant, and you can notice that right in the first scene.<br/><br/>The acting is equally impressing, even Pacino that don&#39;t usually blows my mind like everyone says (Not that he is a bad actor, he&#39;s excellent, but I prefer contained and calm performances), impressed me a lot, he&#39;s so cold and looks so smart that make his turns believable and intelligent. Brando gives one the best performances the world has ever seen, and considering that he was 48 when this movie was released, he convinced me that he was a sick, old man (Which Pacino didn&#39;t do that well in &quot;The Godfather: Part III&quot;). And observe the scene where Hagen tells him about Sonny, and you&#39;ll see what I mean by saying that it&#39;s one of the best of all time.<br/><br/>Verdict: A lot of people, including me, say that it&#39;s the best movie ever made, so they probably have a good reason to say that."
1146,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"It was a movie like a novel. As we know, it&#39;s an adaptation of a short story by Stephen King, and it also feels like reading a classic book. Morgan Freeman is a very good story teller. I would also congratulate Frank Darabont for giving the audience such intense emotions and creating a legend for everyone."

Honestly, I&#39;d already watched it at home before and gave it a 7/10, but seeing it today on the big screen changed a lot. The details in the scenes, the lighting, and even Nino Rota&#39;s soundtrack felt much stronger. The mafia atmosphere came through in a deeper way, almost like I was experiencing the story for the first time. This time, I really enjoyed it more and gave it an 8/10. The cinema experience added a whole new level of grandeur."

3413,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The head of the Mafia clan, Vito Corleone, marries off his daughter Connie. Just in time for the wedding, Don Vito&#39;s youngest son Michael returns from the war. He has fought heroically and returned home with the firm conviction not to continue his father&#39;s business, but to do honest business. Don Corleone and his clan grow richer and more influential every year, which naturally displeases other members of the New York underworld. By cunning manipulations and intrigues, Carleone&#39;s enemies first kill one of Vito&#39;s men, and then make an attempt on the Don himself. Michael vows to save his father and declares war on the criminal gangs.<br/><br/>Italian by birth, but American by birth, Francis Ford Copolla had already won an Oscar before The Godfather, but as a screenwriter. The first part of the gangster saga brought him real fame, as it won three Oscars upon its release, and was acknowledged as an important film work in the US and throughout the world.<br/><br/>In 1969, a book by Mario Puzo, The Godfather, was published, making a lot of noise and becoming a national bestseller. The book tells the story of the harsh laws in the world of Italian mafiosi, of which many Americans did not even know. Two years later, because of his poverty, Puso sold the screen rights to the 33-year-old Copolla. The young director dared to make such a difficult film by inviting Hollywood icon Marlon Brando to the lead role. The second main role, he asked actors such as Robert De Niro, Martin Sheen and Robert Redford, but Copolla refused all, inviting this role to an unknown actor Al Pacino, whom he noticed in the film &quot;Panic in Needle Park. The role immediately earned Pacino an Oscar nomination, which, however, he ignored.<br/><br/>The phenomenon of the popularity of such a violent film lies in the fact that Copolla, using tough artistic techniques, showed the true value of family. The director succeeded in revealing the drama of the picture, which lies in the tragedy of a war hero and a very honest young man, Michael, who had to transcend his own beliefs under the pressure of responsibility and family interests. His transformation from a simple boy to a violent mobster is one of the most skilful metamorphoses in world cinema."

Diane Keaton also gave a magnificent performance as Kay.<br/><br/>Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor Marlon Brando (although he refused to accept it because of the discrimination against Indians), &quot;The Godfather&quot; has become a staple in my house.  I think it&#39;s a movie that everyone should see, and I think many people will agree. Therefore, I give this flawless work a 10."

5013,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I think that the Godfather is an American classic, that perfectly mixes film and real history regarding the Italian mafia. I watched this film with my grandfather, and it was the basis for my senior thesis. i have studied Coppola&#39; touch, and am studying to be a director myself. The Godfather is the reason that i myself am invested in the film industry. i want to make movies for the records. I want to make movies that for generations will be remembered. The cinematography is stellar, and the acting is classic. Al Pacino is playing a golden role and Marlon Brando live through these characters. this movie all around is one of the greatest movies every made for the silver screen."
4239,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Watched 2019-11-29.<br/><br/>An altogether enjoyable watch. The acting is quite exquisite, the story is captivating and there is no wonder as to why this movie is deemed one of the best classics of all time."
4263,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my life, it is simply perfect in pretty much every aspect of it, from it&#39;s acting, to it&#39;s writing, this movie has it all. It stars Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando in his greatest performance. Michael at first tries to stay away from the family business, but after his father is almost assassinated by rivals, he volunteers to murder the responsible, and after his father dies he takes the family business leading to the second installment in the Godfather trilogy. My favorite part of the movie is the baptism scene, which showcases both Michael&#39;s descent into darkness, and Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s great talent in directing. So in summary this is simply the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life."
469,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that creates a sense of mystery and power. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie by displaying their roles as best friends. After watching that movie for the first time, I remembered clips that are drilled into my mind forever. It is beautifully written and directed. The scene that sticks out to me is at the end of the movie when Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot; Redding reunite at the end of the movie. This promotes the aspect of friendship that will live on forever. Even though these two men have lived in prison for years, they eventually got out (well Andy escaped) and they still managed to find one of the most important things in their lives, each other. I recommend this movie to all ages. Although this movie may be a complex the first time you watch it, but after several other times, it still creates a sense of thrill and hope for the viewers. 10 out of 10!"
3276,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is my favourite and the best movie for.
I&#39;ve watched it over and over for so many times.
It showed me the reality aspect out of those ideal heroic epics.
It taught me how to be a truely good son, boyfriend or person.
It&#39;s such a masterpiece."
451,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy&#39;s demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.<br/><br/>By creating the film&#39;s firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film&#39;s success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King&#39;s equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.<br/><br/>While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film&#39;s score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film&#39;s needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman&#39;s score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.<br/><br/>With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. http://howtogetridofacnequick.org"
2643,tt0068646,The Godfather,"02/04/2019<br/><br/>The Godfather (1972)<br/><br/>Director - Francis Ford Coppola<br/><br/>Cast - Marlon Brando &amp; Al Pacino<br/><br/>Based on the Classic novel &#39;The Godfather&#39; by Mario Puzo, this movie is a resounding masterpiece in the field of arts &amp; entertainment.
So what makes it the greatest movie ever made.
Is it the background score that stirs your soul every time it plays.
Is it the detailed direction by the master Coppola that not only takes you through the character&#39;s journey or the timeline but also helps you unravel deep rooted mysteries of the human psyche.
Is it the alluring cinematography by Gordon Willis that makes every frame in the movie look like the most fascinating visual a human eye can ever stand witness to.
Or is it the Masterclass in Acting given by a Brando as the iconic DON Vito Corleone &amp; furthermore an even better performance by Al Pacino in not only the best role of his acting career, but also the most iconic character ever created on celluloid as Michael Corleone.
I guess this is the problem with this film, that all the creative geniuses in the field of Arts &amp; Entertainment got their A game on &amp; filled it with so much of class, passion, performance &amp; excellence, that the film did not have an option but to be the best film in the world of cinema."
2755,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I really liked &quot;The Godfather&quot; and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70&#39;s, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it&#39;s not.<br/><br/>This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.<br/><br/>The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.<br/><br/>The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.<br/><br/>One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it&#39;s interesting and engaging.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10."
3344,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Well I&#39;m 15 and saw this movie for the first time recently. I must say although it was well acted, written and directed; it was somewhat boring during some portions of the movie, and there were some points where i couldn&#39;t figure out what was going or why it was going on. This was sometimes caused by Brando&#39;s almost unintelligible mumbled accent (my only gripe with the acting). It seems like there was just a classic scene, then some boring filler, another memorable scene, then boring filler, and so on. All in all it&#39;s a good movie and worth watching.<br/><br/>7/10 definitely a classic, just don&#39;t expect and edge of your seat action flick."
1984,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I have seen many many movies and this is simply one of the best. My 2nd favorite film of all time. If you havent seen this film, get up and go to your local blockbuster. Forget that, just go buy it since you&#39;ll want to view it many many times. Be sure to get The Godfather Part II while you&#39;re there."
2220,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Can we imagine the history of cinema without the movie The Godfather with its heroes, atmosphere and music?<br/><br/>Who can believe that the filmmaker of this distinction did not expect his success after the setbacks and obstacles he went through?<br/><br/>Was that legendary success a blessing or a curse?"
233,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"When i rented the movie, i was doubtful, whether to rent it or not. Then i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure, it wud be worthy watching this; and worthy it was. The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and everything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesn&#39;t have any dirty romance or impossible actions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. I won&#39;t say anymore, the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie"
5272,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn&#39;t seen it earlier. The acting from every cast member is standalone, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family and carries the power a mafia head should possess. James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons, with polar ideology but equivalent love for the family. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time you hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get a Metascore of 100 and it is. It was one of the movies which defined the crime genre or to say the gangster genre.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo&#39;s best- selling novel of the same name. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to a ruthless mafia boss."
2508,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Color Grading is spectacular.<br/><br/>Liked the way the story is told!<br/><br/>Good Narrative and not boring at all!<br/><br/>It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone&#39;s daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter&#39;s rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately."
3036,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic."
2237,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I&#39;d been putting off watching The Godfather for some time. Probably because I knew it was a long, weighty movie with a massive reputation and I wanted to make sure I gave it justice.<br/><br/>Well I finally took the plunge and watched it, and I&#39;m sorry to say I don&#39;t know what all the fuss is about. This probably won&#39;t be very popular - but this movie is way way too slow. There is a lot of talking and very little action, which would be OK if the dialogue was special - it isn&#39;t.<br/><br/>What saves The Godfather for me is the performances. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in particular - you can tell they are at the peak of their powers and giving the performance everything. Their characters are complex and interesting. Brando as Don Vito Corleone is a criminal but with a good heart. Al Pacino wants to avoid crime but he has a streak of evil in him. The development of the characters and handover of the criminal empire keeps the otherwise dull storyline ticking over.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve given this movie a 7/10 on the strength of the performance, but I won&#39;t be watching it again."
212,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,One of the nicest films ever and immortal in memory
1831,tt0068646,The Godfather,"No doubt, it&#39;s a good movie or we can say better than many gang star or mafia movies. But, it&#39;s really overrated, I give a watch after seeing its viewers review &quot;the best&quot; &amp; ranked 2nd in imdb rating.<br/><br/>Trust me it will bore you until Micheal take over his family business and excluding some part of DON CORLEONE.<br/><br/>This movie remained silent in describing the characters or some incident to viewers. Even the storyline ,tbh it didn&#39;t amaze me at all. More, it doesn&#39;t even show the business which they tried to show the main motto of the families. Rather,it engaged you with the fighting, sometimes left u to think why is it happening? No proper reaction. After Micheal takes over ,it shows one deal of business in Vegas .<br/><br/>So as a whole, the movie gets into track after MIcheal turns in business.<br/><br/>Some killings may got more attentions in the movie.<br/><br/>Gradually the interest will shift from DON to Micheal. The development Micheal,yeah that really make the movie great. Besides,the acting of Don Corleone is perfect ."
1852,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Are you kidding me? This movie is at best a 6 on a good day. The mere fact that this movie continually shows up on AFI&#39;s Top Ten list tells me that action and brutality are preferred by Americans over plot and acting. It is a decent film but nothing more. There is no way it is in the same league as &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, or &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. It angers me every time this movie gets voted # 2 on some movie list. Al Pacino and Brando are good, but it was not the best work that either of these actors produced. It is an entertaining film like &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and &quot;National Treasure&quot; but it is not a classic. It is important to remember that just because a film is popular does not mean that it is a great movie. If you enjoy mob movies this one is probably the best of a bad lot in the modern era, but the older films with Bogart, Cagney, and Robinson put this film to shame. I will be delighted when people one day realize the true worth of this film."
3879,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I gave it a 1/10 score because of the huge degree in which this film is overrated. My actual score for this film would be 9/10: excellent but not a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It is a very good family melodrama, with very well constructed characters and excellent acting, however, I cannot say I loved this film. It is very good, but nothing really special: It is one of my top 100 favorite films, but not top 50. Why? The main flaw of this film is that it lacks visual art: the truly great films work as pieces of audiovisual art, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Coppola&#39;s own Apocalypse Now. This film, by contrast, doesn&#39;t offer anything besides plot and characters. It is not artistically complete as it doesn&#39;t take full advantage of the medium of film.<br/><br/>One problem with this type of film, that is, films restricted by plot, is that by being a film about a family and their petty criminal organization severely restricts the scope and greatness of the film. If, instead, the film was done in a post-apocalyptic setting, where Marlon Brando would be the ruthless leader of a small village in the vast wastelands, and Michael his heir, with a Mad Max 2 felling and more action, it would have been a 10/10 film, because it would have been way more epic. (yeah! :) mundane settings suck: :P )<br/><br/>But, being a film restricted to a petty criminal organization, restricts its greatness: for me a great film needs a great theme and there is little that is lesser in greatness than a gangster theme. It is simply one of those &quot;american&quot; cultural constructs that do not fit in may world view: why one would be so interested in the lives of pathetic criminals?<br/><br/>From a technical perspective this film is great, but from an artistic perspective this film is not that great, it is good, but not great. In conclusion: a very good film, but not a great one. Want a powerful drama? Anderson&#39;s There Will Be Blood is a way more powerful drama film than this one."
1019,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This movie was incredibly unrealistic, I hate how the father lied to his son. it was ridiculous and the son was stupid for believing him. the fact that the father turns into a fish at the end is highly problematic. 2/10"
4706,tt0068646,The Godfather,No much needed to be said about this film except it is a definite must watch.
1770,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Like many, I consider Citizen Kane to be the greatest film of all time. For unknown reasons, Gone With The Wind is my second favourite movie. Right behind these two is The Godfather, the mafia epic that perhaps tops more &quot;best of&quot; lists than Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind today. As my third favourite film, I do not mind The Godfather ranking number 1 on lists and don&#39;t mind when it is raved as being &quot;the greatest of all time.&quot; It is not the best in my eyes, but I can see why it would be the best in others. Anyway, my reaction to seeing The Godfather is just like anybody else&#39;s that feel mesmerized by this mammoth piece of work.<br/><br/>The Godfather launched the careers of director Francis Ford Coppola, author Mario Puzo, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and relaunched the career of Marlon Brando. Because of early classics like On The Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire, Marlon Brando earned the rep as the greatest and most influential actor in film history. With a string of less successful movies right before The Godfather, Brando&#39;s greatest rival, Sir Laurence Olivier (the greatest stage actor of the 20 century), was the original choice to play protagonist, Vito Chorleone. With Olivier still a huge movie star, Brando&#39;s performance in this epic put him back on the map and gave him an Academy Award win for best actor. Others actors, as mentioned above were also nominated for other categories, but all lost. I&#39;m glad they lost, it was such a close call that it would have been a polar-opposing house of opinions.<br/><br/>The Godfather tells the story of the Chorleone family: the most powerful and ruthless mafia clan in America. Don Vito Chorleone (Brando) helps out whomever he feels and makes people &quot;an offer they can&#39;t refuse.&quot; When drug dealer, Sollozzo approaches Vito asking for political protection, Vito, against drugs, declines. So Sollozzo and his current entourage of mob families attempt to kill Vito, which would make his son, Santino (Caan), the new Don as he wants to join Sollozzo. Instead, Vito survives and a deadly web of mob violence explodes. Vito&#39;s youngest son Michael (Pacino), is a war veteran who wants nothing to do with the family business, but as the violence rises and the family drastically weakens, Michael is the only one that can bring the family to their original status, by being more clever and deadlier than his father could ever be.<br/><br/>The first half or so, to me, is more of a thriller than drama. Lots of suspense is created after Vito makes the rejection does not stop until after Michael kills Sollozzo and crooked cop, McCluskey. The second half is a drama as we see the family struggling with their downfall and soon rise. The story get more complex as the movie goes on, which may result in a confusion of who&#39;s who. That is why this movie needs your full, undivided attention and full concentration. It took me a few watches to completely understand. I love movies that require multiple viewings.<br/><br/>The acting is the best ensemble ever put to film. Brando passes the torch to Al Pacino, as this was Brando&#39;s last monumental film and Pacino&#39;s first. I don&#39;t recall any other movie with such good acting by every single actor.<br/><br/>4/4"
2200,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One of the outstanding movie. Actors are very professional and they are giving justice to their characters. Salute to them.<br/><br/>This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
2311,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This was the first mafia story I saw. After watching this one, I saw other similar movies which a follow a group of mafia/criminals usually in a New York City setting, but this one still remains as my favorite. The actors are top notch, and the story is brilliant. Now, kiss my left and right cheek!"

1956,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I would like to tell everyone that this movie is highly overated expecially considering it is the number one movie in the IMDB TOP 250 LIST!!  Dont get me wrong i like like Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s movies but i have never been a fan of this series!!  He definatly has an all star line up , but come on people Marlon Brando cannot act his way out of a paper bag!! Just like one of my favorite Coppola movies &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; Marlon got top billing over Martin Sheen when right well Martin should have been the oscar nominee!! It is a good trilogy but let me tell you something? If you want a good down to earth mob movie see anything done by Martin Scorsese! I wasnt really over touched by this series but i know it has alot of fans!! See ya folks!!!"
5262,tt0068646,The Godfather,Very very well movie.<br/><br/>And very conceptual and beautiful film.
3697,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I really like the movie that was temporarily #1 - &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. I agree with a lot of what&#39;s in the charts though think some films here are over-rated. And this is what I felt about &quot;The Godfather&quot;. It&#39;s very well made, etc. but it&#39;s also a bit boring.<br/><br/>On a production level, it&#39;s hard to fault &quot;The Godfather&quot; and Coppola&#39;s handling of events. There&#39;s an intense level of detail, as he charts the rise of Vito Corleone to prominence, and the lengths people go to attain power. The direction is great - there&#39;s a real sense of epic-ness here. The city and times seem alive before you. There&#39;s a great sense of realism - helped, for example, by the use of speaking Italian in the movies because - hey Hollywood - not everyone would want to, or choose to, constantly speak English. It&#39;s rich and lush and has a quality nearly all films lack nowadays in their haste to please the lowest-common-denominator.<br/><br/>The acting is spot on. In fact it&#39;s probably above that. It&#39;s excellent. Pacino is at his height here - wonderful as the naive Michael Corleone who has to learn the family trade. Marlon Brando&#39;s &quot;Vito Corleone&quot; has become so infamous that seeing him is almost like watching a caricature (as are many of the lines) but he&#39;s on fine form, though I preferred his fresher, more engaging role in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.<br/><br/>And yet for all the unquestionable production values and acting... I found it all a tad dull. I don&#39;t have an aversion to the genre - &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos&quot; are superb - but I found the pacing slow, almost monotonous in places. There is an attention to detail, and an epic scope, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily translate to interesting viewing. &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; dragged me into the sweeping sands, yet I wasn&#39;t dragged in here to anything approaching the same degree. There&#39;s character development but, as we touch up and down upon certain moments in the lives of the Corleones, we&#39;re never given any sense of more fluid developments. We see their actions from a distance and find it harder to empathise or care about them. It all adds up to a muted viewing experience for me, and I felt indifferent to his hailed classic.<br/><br/>I can&#39;t knock &quot;The Godfather&quot; too much, because it has a lot going for it. As one reviewer commented it, even those who don&#39;t like it feel forced to rate it highly because they must acknowledge the craftsmanship here. For all that I was quite disappointed by this movie and can only give it 8/10 (and that&#39;s because of the talent involved). The &quot;sequel&quot; was better, but not by much. Not deserving of #1 in my opinion."
273,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"From the director of 1990&#39;s &quot;Buried Alive&quot; comes perhaps the strongest drama of 1994. &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is emotionally fulfilling in every way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabont&#39;s screenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen King&#39;s short novella &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot;, is at once soul stirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank Darabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely unpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of loving care that only a writer/director can, ensuring that all the right elements are brought to the surface.<br/><br/>Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire support cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted double murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and determination superbly. He&#39;s a man who not only strongly believes he has a future, but that it&#39;s a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world weary &quot;Red&quot;, the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise (&quot;whatever you want&quot;) to other inmates. He is gradually transformed, and always surprised, by Andy&#39;s optimism, geniality and brilliance. In support of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an over all feast of superlative acting talents.<br/><br/>The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the foreboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman&#39;s music is awe inspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition.<br/><br/>&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is a long movie, though it would seem that to shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial scenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.<br/><br/>What makes this film so effective is Darabont&#39;s brilliant script and astute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support production. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry, listen and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. We&#39;re left in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is unexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph of the human spirit.<br/><br/>Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not expected, and that&#39;s what makes this story so great. &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written characters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully emotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure that you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played characters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton) and the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy Brown).<br/><br/>Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema<br/><br/>&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank Darabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far the best prison film I&#39;ve ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend strong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas Newman&#39;s score is sweeping and melodic.<br/><br/>For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its audience you can&#39;t go past &quot;The Shawshank Redemption.&quot;<br/><br/>Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre"
4534,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."
521,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen, it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen.  The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I&#39;ve heard"
3975,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I recently watched the film The Godfather directed by Francis Ford Coppolla and based on the book by Mario Puzo. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. The film takes place in New York in a post-World War II setting. The films is a stirring drama filled with poignant moments throughout.<br/><br/>This film follows the lives of the Corleone family who is one of the five organized crime families that control the city and state of New York. This film takes you through the good and the bad sides of an organized crime family. The film has moments where you forget that this family is a mob family who commits murders like others commit minor traffic violations. Some of the more memorable scenes in the movie include the very opening scene in the movie when The Godfather (Vito Corleone) is sitting in a dark home office setting where he is receiving any guest to his daughter&#39;s wedding who has a request for him. Apparently there is an old Sicilian tradition that says that a father cannot refuse any reasonable request on the day that his daughter is to be married. Why haven&#39;t I been invited to more Italian weddings? I&#39;m getting really tired of dealing with my wife telling me to clean up after I make a mess. Where is a Godfather when you need him? Another scene that caught my attention is a meeting that the Corleone family has with a man by the name of Sollozzo. This man has an offer for the family to begin moving the family into the drug business. The scene gets me because you would think that a mob boss would be up for whatever if it means making money, but not Don Corleone. He almost seems like a respectable business man who would not do anything that has to do with drugs. This scene is pivotal as it sets in motion the events of the rest of the movie. Upon the refusal of Sollozzo&#39;s offer he sets up an assassination attempt on The Godfather&#39;s life which is carried out but fails as the Don lives through the attempt. After the assassination attempt there has to be a reaction from the family and to everyone&#39;s surprise this gets Michael Corleone involved in the family business that he swore he would never be involved with. Michael&#39;s involvement leads him to carry out the assassination of Sollozzo and the chief of police. This act of vengeance leads Michael to a yearlong hide out in Italy while the rest of the family and their associates go to the mats for a bitter mob war. There are many other moments in the film to be seen and the film moves in a very unpredictable way that has to be seen rather than told in a film review.<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of the movie is the background music that plays at certain times in the movie. It is nothing that is going to blow you away, and it isn&#39;t anything that you are going to recognize unless you are familiar with some sort of dark orchestra that I have never heard of before. The movie plays music at the right times and it does an amazing job of building the suspense of the scenes where it has been included. One example is toward the end of the movie when Michael&#39;s nephew is being baptized and the movie is going through a series of parallel cuts and the music does an amazing job of building the suspense during this scene. This is a classic example of someone doing their homework and realizing that sometimes music can be done to the point of overkill. No worries of that here just a great job by the sound crew.<br/><br/>Another fine job in the movie is the acting. The cast of this movie was brilliantly put together and each character is played absolutely brilliantly. From The Godfather down to the Mafioso&#39;s who work for him each character is played with precision and by men and women who seem to fit the roles that they were cast for as if they were leading their normal lives. The casting crew gets a round of applause from me for the job that they did with this film.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a film that will stand the test of time when it comes to motion pictures. With a brilliant plot and a moving storyline this movie is one of the best that I have ever seen. The characters portray a group that seem for all intents and purposes to be a real family who love and care about one another while going about their daily lives of committing murders and breaking the law. This film will be one of the greats of all time and it will leave viewers with a sense of wanting to be a part of a crime syndicate like the Corleone family. I encourage anyone who enjoys movies that tell a story in a moving and powerful way to go and see The Godfather. I promise that you will not be disappointed and you will be begging for more by the time that the movie is over. My overall film rating for this movie is a resounding 5 out of 5 trigger fingers because I think that they work better for this movie than stars or thumbs. Go see the movie and enjoy!"
3539,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Being a youth (but I would safely consider myself now as an adult), I never get into much witnessing adult stories. I now realize that most of them are undoubtedly beautiful stories. Haven&#39;t read yet prior to the film Mario Puzo&#39;s novel, I pulled my guts to watch the film and did my best to understand the story as much as I do with other good-storied films. Godfather 1 had indeed made me witness another beautiful story of different origin. I never imagined how many beautiful stories would still be lingering out there, of every nature, of any environment or of any country it originates. Watching the film, starts with Marlon Brando playing the role of Don Vito Corleone, known as well as the &quot;Godfather&quot;. I didn&#39;t quite understand really the way how crime worlds work, but to me I get the opportunity to understand dealing business with wits and cunning as how you deal practically with your teacher in school. The situation is different, but manner of dealing them is nonetheless similar. I appreciated well the film for Italian&#39;s value of family, relationship and trust. How Don Vito Corleone manage to deal business mixing trust and respect differently. How he mends and considers things equally and with weight. This is the first time I observed for the first time Al Pacino grasping a character filled with composure and serenity, and maintained such equanimity after tides turned inevitable to him in the story. I had to admit it is one of the excellent films I&#39;ve watch so far. The characters, the setting, the environment, the story itself is so genuine and good that you couldn&#39;t deny it as a considerably first-rate film."
5191,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Mario Puzo&#39;s novel about crime, corruption, family and loyalty comes to life with the help of Francis Ford Coppola in The Godfather. The Corleone family, headed by the aging Vito Corleone, is the most powerful family on the East coast, and possibly all of America. They &quot;own&quot; senators, judges and policemen. They are above the law. Vito&#39;s son, Michael, has just returned from the war a hero, and wants no part in the family business. But when an up and coming rival family wanting to get into the drug trade asks the Corleones for protection, Don Vito declines their offer, sticking to his traditional Sicilian values. The other families aren&#39;t as concerned about the old ways and want in, but know that they can&#39;t do business without the Corleones&#39; influence. So, they have Don Corleone shot, expecting to gain leverage with the Don out of action. Luckily, the Don survives and Michael, furious with the attempt on his father&#39;s life, steps up to take out the opposition.<br/><br/>Soon, Michael, originally wanting nothing to do with the family business, proves himself to be quite a strategist, always playing mind games with everyone. Everyone except his father, of course. Michael slowly crawls up the ladder of power, destroying anyone who gets in his way, until he sits comfortably at the top. Ruthlessness is his tool and he wields it well. Only those inside the family and his small circle of long term friends are safe from his wrath.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando&#39;s Vito Corleone is magnificent. Brando portrays him perfectly as the tough and feared old patriarch that, although brutal to his enemies, loves and cares for his family. His raspy whisper and deliberate movements will forever echo in film history (already having been parodied and imitated countless times).<br/><br/>Al Pacino&#39;s Michael Corleone makes a very gradual transformation from the respectable war hero with a nice girlfriend to a full-fledged criminal mastermind. At the beginning of the film, Michael is a friendly young man who wants no part in his father&#39;s world. In the very last scene, he is a dangerous, cold-blooded sociopath who still cares for his family, but will do anything to further his influence. Pacino gives a career-making performance and fits perfectly into the role of brilliant anti-hero (as well as the roles of Tony Montana in Scarface and Sonny Wortzik in Dog Day Afternoon that would come later in his career).<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s directing is perfect. The dark, dramatic lighting used inside the Don&#39;s office is a trademark of foreboding danger and power. Everything from the gruesome and, sometimes, disturbing execution killings to the way Vito Corleone looks at his son, Michael, adds to the intoxicating blend of brutality and love that Coppola serves his audience.<br/><br/>Nino Rota&#39;s score only spices up the brew with his traditional Italian-sounding pieces that conjure up images of tough Sicilian men riding horse-back through rugged terrain in the old country. A beautiful soundtrack to an already beautiful film.<br/><br/>The Godfather is about how the human mind is affected by crisis, opportunity and corruption. Michael Corleone does not involve himself in the family business until they go after his father. This proves to be the catalyst. Michael takes the plunge into the underworld and, upon realizing that he is smarter than all of the other families put together, only goes deeper. He plays the game of crime like chess. He plans his moves and has all the angles covered. He strikes swiftly and without mercy. Michael Corleone is a criminal, but he is very different from the goon knocking over a 7-11 with a pen-knife. Coppola has created a masterpiece."

This movie has gained a larger audience through word of mouth than it had the entire time it was in the theaters.  This is quite simply one of the three best movies I&#39;ve ever seen."

THE DON. His transformation shows how amazing Pacino is as an actor. Him and De Niro who I consider the greatest two actors in the last 40 years both rules the 70s, they prove it again in the sequel that I don&#39;t find quite as good as the original, even though MANY people think that this is the one time the sequel finally surpasses the original in the Godfather Series.<br/><br/>I do not.<br/><br/>I think this first Godfather is leaps ahead of the rest, not exactly leaps maybe in front of the second but most definitely the third.<br/><br/>While I like Heat and Goodfellas more then the Godfather I think this is a perfect 10 out of 10 for everything. The morals, the messages, the family values, the acting, the story, the action, the characters, everything in this film is flawless.<br/><br/>This movie is one you need to be in the mood to watch due to the length and its time, but you feel slick after watching so many performances.<br/><br/>This what film-making is all about.<br/><br/>This is Cinema.<br/><br/>One of the greatest movies ever made and it will be like that for years to come.<br/><br/>A movie that will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>A movie....you just cant refuse!<br/><br/>10."

The movie won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Marlon Brando.don&#39;t have too much to say about it, but GOD DAMN THAT MOVIE WAS AMAZING!! Going into it, my expectations were cautious because of how hyped it is. I know it is considered one of the greatest films of all time, and with how long it is I expected at least a little bit of dragged out plot or slowness, but every single moment was riveting. This movie is absolutely the best I&#39;ve ever seen in regards to knowing when and how to present the story. It reserves itself and only gets brutal/intense when necessary, and even the most simple and quiet of scenes have an immense sense of meaning to them. My heart pounded harder than it EVER has in a movie."

I remember it really well - I was 16, my parents were abroad and I watched it at home with a couple of good friends. When you remember the time and setting you watched a movie so well, it is because it really touched you and influenced you, and that&#39;s what I think that movie did to me. You really should watch it. It is an offer you can&#39;t refuse!"

Despite the length of the movie, I was thoroughly engaged throughout. When a movie has you routing for the bad guys, it demonstrates the impact of an excellent story well executed. The film is so much more than just a gangster movie. It addresses politics, family values, crime and the social norms of the time. I know that I will watch this many more times as well as the Godfather films which follow. Fast paced, excellent acting, great music all combine to make this a must see."
657,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;d held off on seeing the Shawshank Redemption. I remained a little apprehensive; was this film as great as the masses of IMDb and particularly world wide were saying? From the moment I began watching this film to the very end, I was kept completely in awe at how beautiful and amazing this film is.<br/><br/>The Shawshank Redemption is a film set in a US Prison, following the story of Andy Dufrense who was sent to Shawshank for a crime in which he did not forget. Here, he meets Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) an aged convict who, unlike the majority of the populace, accepts that he is a guilty man. The two develop a friendship over the lasting years, which evolves into what could be akin to brotherhood.<br/><br/>The message of hope in this film is as inspirational as it is an interesting concept. Despite being convicted, Andy undertakes a quest to become a free man once more, even if it means breaking the laws and, as shown later in the film, breaking out of Shawshank<br/><br/>The acting in this film is simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman, providing both a character and the narration of said character, portrays his character in such a convincing way that one can&#39;t help but feel moved by his dialogue. Bob Gunton, who plays Warden Norton (an immensely corrupt individual), passes himself off in such a brilliant performance that I couldn&#39;t help but feel pure anger for the Warden throughout the movie.<br/><br/>But perhaps what makes this movie so beautiful is the underlying messages. Despite being incarcerated for life without parole, Andy maintains hope, despite what the others say when he freely speaks of it. The evolving friendship of Red and himself delivers the message that not all criminals are rabid beasts, and that friendship can outlast the grim depression of a prison. Though I am by no means proud to admit it, I felt myself become watery-eyed several times throughout the film, particularly the letter sent by Brooks before he commits suicide, climaxing in a tragic, heart-breaking scene.<br/><br/>Wherever you are in the world, you must see this movie. It will most certainly change your life. It did mine."

I&#39;m not sure why it wasn&#39;t a hit a first because, like virtually everybody else who has watched it, I loved everything about this film and would also consider it to be one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>I can&#39;t add much more to the 4,116 reviews that have already been written, but what I will say is that I&#39;ve never felt so emotionally involved in a film before as I did with this one. I&#39;d heard great things about the &#39;Shawshank&#39; and that can often lead to disappointment, but in this case my expectations were far exceeded. I have to mention the ending as well, which is just poetic - in my opinion the greatest ending to a film ever.<br/><br/>An average rating of 9.3 on IMDb from over 1.6 million votes is truly remarkable, but thoroughly deserved. I can&#39;t speak highly enough of &#39;The Shawshank Redemption&#39;, an amazing film that is sure to leave you feeling emotionally overwhelmed."

First, everyone is free, don¡¯t be controlled by others, you have your ideas and behavior. Second, don¡¯t give up your courage; face the truth with your braveness. No one can help you, but yourself.

3118,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I do not like old school movies, but it is my number movie off all times. There are certain things in life that are so exquisite that 26 Alphabets seem inadequate to adequately explain them. They go beyond the limited scope of the 26 alphabets. Instead of rating or reviewing such things, you should personally experience them. One of the most exquisite motion pictures and television shows ever made. I mean, if they were able to make such high-caliber films in 1970, which the most skilled individuals are unable to do so in 2021, then the folks who built and developed this were truly ahead of their time. It will be unusual to see this 1970s-created, 1950s-based sitcom in 2021. I have a tendency to screenshot the moments that would make the most stunning posters."

Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film&#39;s most engaging characters.<br/><br/>Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making,"

4775,tt0068646,The Godfather,"There are films that entertain, and then there are films that reshape the very language of storytelling. The Godfather is the latter-a towering achievement in cinema that blends operatic tragedy with intimate human drama, all under the shadow of power, loyalty, and inevitable decay.<br/><br/>From its haunting opening line-&quot;I believe in America&quot;-to its final, chilling door close on Kay, the film is a symphony of tension, beauty, and moral ambiguity. Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s direction is flawless, crafting a world that feels both mythic and brutally real. Every frame is deliberate, every silence loaded, every glance a chess move in a game of survival.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando&#39;s Don Vito Corleone is iconic not just for the voice and the cotton-stuffed cheeks, but for the quiet dignity he brings to a man who rules through respect more than fear. And Al Pacino&#39;s transformation from reluctant son to ruthless heir is one of the most compelling character arcs ever put to screen-subtle, terrifying, and utterly believable.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Gordon Willis bathes the film in shadows, as if the characters themselves are being swallowed by the darkness they create. Nino Rota&#39;s score is mournful and majestic, echoing the film&#39;s themes of family, loss, and the cost of power.<br/><br/>But what makes The Godfather truly transcendent is its emotional depth. It&#39;s not just a gangster film-it&#39;s a meditation on legacy, identity, and the price of loyalty. It asks: What are we willing to sacrifice to protect those we love? And at what point does protection become possession?"
3202,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The movie is more than worth watching, it is one of the classic movies of the American cinematography. Al Pacino is as always great. And the story, the atmosphere and the spirit of Italian-American neighborhoods, of &quot;old school&quot; mafia, &quot;La Cosa Nostra&quot;, was transferred amazingly great. You shall see lots of interesting stuff about Italian Mafia traditions, about their Code, that used to value back in the days. In my humble opinion, the second part (The Godfather II) is not as good as this one, and you should definitely see at least this. I remember I first heard of this movie from my grandfather. And if he advised the movie, it meant that it&#39;s good indeed. This one was not an exception."

Directed by Frank Darabont and adapted from a Stephen King novella, this film is a powerful exploration of hope, resilience, and the enduring power of the human spirit.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Amidst the harsh realities of prison life, Andy&#39;s unwavering hope and intelligence allow him to forge unlikely friendships, navigate the corrupt system, and ultimately engineer a remarkable escape.<br/><br/>One of the film&#39;s greatest strengths lies in its exceptional performances. Tim Robbins delivers a compelling and nuanced portrayal of Andy, capturing his quiet determination and unwavering belief in his own innocence. Morgan Freeman, as the wise and world-weary Red, provides a steady and insightful narration, grounding the story and offering poignant reflections on the human condition.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s cinematography is stunning, capturing the bleakness of the prison environment while also highlighting moments of beauty and hope. The score, composed by Thomas Newman, perfectly complements the emotional depth of the story, enhancing the impact of each scene.<br/><br/>The Shawshank Redemption is more than just a prison drama; it is a timeless tale of redemption and the triumph of the human spirit. It is a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, inspiring viewers to hold onto hope even in the darkest of times."
3464,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a film of undeniable triumph; everything from the set to the sound and lighting, the score to the amazing cast, is perfect and Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s vision does justice to Mario Puzo&#39;s stylish crime novel, with the author partnering with Coppola on the screenplay. The film is a masterpiece of acting and direction, with Coppola&#39;s influence clear, and the work of stars such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall centre-stage in a beautifully dark and corrupt tale of a powerful Italian crime family. Never has the Mafia been better depicted in cinema, and I opine never will it be again."
3420,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It&#39;s a truly incredible movie. I always postponed watching it until today. I wish I had watched it before. The movie is so absorbing, both with its script and acting, that you cannot get out of its influence even after the movie ends. One of the best movies of those times. All the emotions and events are handled so beautifully that the performances of the actors are not even a matter of course. A movie that every person should watch before they die. It&#39;s a movie that still holds its own despite all these years. I definitely recommend you watch it. The acting, especially of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, was magnificent."

But I&#39;ll give it a shot. Here goes.<br/><br/>This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.<br/><br/>I mean, for gods sake, its so damn good it takes your breath away! i seriously could not speak after it! it instantly took every other film i had seen under its shadow, and that&#39;s saying something, as i have seen some pretty excellent films.<br/><br/>There&#39;s not a single actor or actress in this movie who is crap!!! standouts are Morgan freeman, Tim Robbins, and the dude who plays brooks.<br/><br/>I could say 1239643609260246704272628xinfinity more things good about this movie, but unfortunately I haven&#39;t got that much space, and my fingers would get sore.<br/><br/>An absolute must see for everyone, and I&#39;m positive that ill never see another movie better than this, and this will stay at #1 on my list forever."
4893,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Sicilian Mafia working in America, the notorious head of the family, Don Corleone, fighting for the pride of the family. The epic mafia films pictured the mafia well, awesome."
1844,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Being without doubt a quality movie (good plot, good acting, good directing) it is mysterious however why it is considered by many people to be the best ever made. The origin of this mystery needs some exploration. <br/><br/>I think that technically the film is pretty well made although not without a flaw. I knew the great Nino Rota&#39;s melody long before I saw this movie and I was amazed how it was wasted in the film. Just an intermezzo??? And horribly performed...  <br/><br/>I can suggest two reasons for the too high rating. 1. Americans adore their Mafia. And the film appeals to the desire of a simple man to imagine himself a deadly hero. That would explain also why it does not touch me too much. 2. The film was innovative in the time it appeared in manner I don&#39;t understand. Perhaps there were some cinematographic tricks that were revolutionary at the time and used in every other film since (that would explain why we do not see them). <br/><br/>Godfather II impressed me much more because it goes against the first of the mentioned above reasons. No romanticism of the vengeance, no protection of the family any more. I think it was very courageous to show the bare face of Mafia in the country that adored it.  Deadly businessmen of the Godfather II are really horrifying. <br/><br/>I cannot comment on suggestion number 2. But it any case that reason can have only historical significance.<br/><br/>My rating for the film is 8 of 10."
837,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"At the time of this writing &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; occupies the top spot in IMDb&#39;s list of top rated films. I will state right off the bat that I don&#39;t agree with that assessment but that doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t think the film is a fine one.<br/><br/>The story (based on a Stephen King novella) concerns a man sent to Shawshank Penitentiary after being convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Once there he undergoes many hardships but eventually befriends the resident dealer in contraband and strikes an accord with the guards and warden. However, through it all he never loses the hope that someday, somehow he&#39;ll regain his freedom.<br/><br/>The cast is commendable. Morgan Freeman delivered the film&#39;s best performance and landed a well-deserved Oscar nomination in the process. Tim Robbins was excellent as well, giving one of the best performances of his career. The remainder of the cast is filled out by an assortment of well-chosen character actors. Of these, Bob Gunton &amp; James Whitmore deserve special praise.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s production values don&#39;t disappoint either though they are undeniably not at quite the same level as the films that critics usually dub the best of all time. Frank Darabont&#39;s direction is tasteful, though, and is bolstered by Oscar-nominated cinematography courtesy of eight time nominee Roger Deakins. Thomas Newman&#39;s Oscar-nominated score has some memorable moments and provides solid support throughout.<br/><br/>In the end, though, while the film is indeed admirable from a technical standpoint, it is the emotional impact that has made it a favorite of so many. Naturally, emotional responses will vary from person to person but this film seems to hit the mark more than any other. Do yourself a favour and check it out."
4329,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I went into this film with a chip on my shoulder that was determined not to like it and I was only watching it in order to scratch it off of my film poster. I don&#39;t like gangster films really, glorifying violence and illegal activities has never been in my wheelhouse, but I have to say that this one was so well made, so well acted and such a good story that I couldn&#39;t help but enjoy it.<br/><br/>It starts out with a great pace that takes you through things day by day, which it slightly loses towards the end, when suddenly we are skipping ahead months or years at a time and with a much slower feel to the action, but I was already sold on the film as a whole, so I didn&#39;t mind too much at all.<br/><br/>It&#39;s obvious why it appears on every top films list I&#39;ve ever come across. Yes, you could trim about 15 minutes off of it, but at what cost, I don&#39;t think that there is anything in this film that shouldn&#39;t be there, the perspective shots and set ups are all important I feel.
The director, editor and crew in general have all done a fantastic job to bring this Mafioso story to life with a careful and considerate vision.<br/><br/>What I would call the gross bits aren&#39;t so offensive to put me off my tiramisu and the bad language is part and parcel, without being overused to prove how bad they are.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a shame to see the sweeter and more innocent Michael slowly get drawn in to the trouble, but you can see why he finds that path and that&#39;s what makes the story interesting.<br/><br/>The actors all give great performances. Mother thought that Robert Duvall in particular was outstanding for giving us a side of him that we don&#39;t see that often in his other roles, which can sometimes be a bit more quirky and I have to say that I agree with the old grotbags.<br/><br/>However, I have always had a thing about Mr Brando that I just can&#39;t ignore (If I ever get a time machine, you&#39;ll find me in his changing room for &#39;Streetcar Named Desire&#39;). I thought he was fantastic, especially as he gets older towards the end of the film. I didn&#39;t quite understand why he looked like he&#39;d been to the dentist and forgotten to take the cotton wool out though? I&#39;m not sure it added anything, except to add a talking point or a gimmick. Were they trying to make jowls where there were none or was it an old wives tale way of trying to clear his obviously congested sinuses? Whatever it was, he was superb.<br/><br/>Al gave a great performance too, surely paving the way to his lead role in &#39;Scarface&#39;.
I was also incredibly surprised to find myself looking at James Caan with bedroom eyes. My only references to him previously have been &#39;Elf&#39; and &#39;Misery&#39;, so to see him so youthful and handsome was a pleasant change.<br/><br/>If you like gangster/mobster films then this one is a sure win for you, but even if you don&#39;t generally like them you should give it a go.<br/><br/>I have Part II lined up to watch in the next few days. It will be interesting to see where it goes with the fabulous Robert De Niro on board too."
2422,tt0068646,The Godfather,One of the best trilogy made till date. Despite the slow move of the movie sequences it catches the attention of the viewer. A better way to represent the DON families of that time.
3571,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I read some of the other reviews that people posted and wanted to say it was quite possibly the greatest movie ever! For those who voted it badly, I can see why..partially. The first time I saw it for some reason, I couldn&#39;t get into it. I had to stop it and continue watching it another day. It seemed to bore me. That is until they whacked off a few of the best characters in the movie. I swear I could hardly recover from those blows. When they Killed Sonny I couldn&#39;t believe it!!! He was my favorite actor in the movie as with Marlon Brando! At least the movie did it so tastefully that even in the manner of their deaths, I was shocked by the delievery of them. Although I must say they should have put more details in with Sonny&#39;s death, The effects weren&#39;t that great plus I&#39;m beginning to think he is like tony Montana because he gets rittled with at least 4 tommygun rounds and still manages to get out of the car and goes down after 10 rounds; remarkable! If I were him I would have at least floored it!!!! NOT GET OUT OF THE CAR!"
1877,tt0068646,The Godfather,This movie is one of thé best pièce of art in thé history of humanity
4636,tt0068646,The Godfather,this movie was horrible i don&#39;t understand how this is a good movie. Al Pacino&#39;s worst movie. Marlon Brando was horrible. So many people say how good this is but i think this movie should be burned. Francis ford Coppola is a bad director. Goerge Lucas is the best director ever. I&#39;d give this movie a 3.0 on a 10 scale. The best movie in the world is easily material girls. Hilary duff is so hot in that movie. The screen play was bad the acting was bad and the director was bad. A movie you should see is Material girls the best movie ever. Good directing screenplay and defiantly acting. Another good movie was From Justin to Kelly. Justin is hot in his swimsuit but Kelly needs to lose pounds.
2600,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather deserves to be called the best movie in history, and from my personal point of view, nothing is wrong with it"
4447,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Let me start by saying that I didn&#39;t particularly enjoy the Godfather. I found the film too slow paced, and James Caan was extremely irritable. Vito took FOREVER to recover, and when he did he choked it not long later.<br/><br/>Saying that, I respect the film and Coppola on the effort and technical prowess on show. Al Pacino is brilliant, if a little predictable, while Robert Duvall steals the spotlight if you ask me, with a truly masterful performance.<br/><br/>The final scene will always be remembered, and for good reason, its artistically genius, but I won&#39;y give it away.<br/><br/>This film isn&#39;t for everyone, so don&#39;t worry if you think you oughta enjoy it just because it&#39;s ranked number 1 in the top 250. Just remember that films are always about opinion, and there can never be justifiable official &quot;Greatest Movie&quot;, so if you don&#39;t like it fine, don&#39;t let other people hound you down just because they insist that it&#39;s the perfect film, because as far as I&#39;m concerned, there can never be a perfect film.<br/><br/>As Peter Griffin once said, &quot;It insists upon itself Louis&quot;."

1437,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top &quot;prison&quot; movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more. Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that&#39;s not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don&#39;t know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through."
1380,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,The best story of a good friendship I have ever seen. The way the story develops is unbelievebly well done. The cast is sublime at delivering top of the bill acting. I was left speechless throughout the whole last hour and left crying and laughing from ear to ear at the final scene.<br/><br/>If I could score it higher than 10/10 I would.
2576,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is considered a &quot;classic&quot; gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he&#39;s only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about &quot;important&quot; issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they&#39;re gonna kill. It&#39;s just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they&#39;re gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you&#39;re not missing much."
399,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>It is very hard to call &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (1994) a masterpiece, but it is a definitely one of the most inspiring and beautifully crafted picture off all time. That said, i won&#39;t going into details, as plot and everything about this movie is so well known. To simply put, this is a story of two men in prison sentenced to life time and their journey to redemption. <br/><br/>Seeing this movie ~ 5 times in my life i can say that when some time passes, you kinda feel a need to re-watch it again, because this movie is like a journey itself, with characters drawn so sharply that we do care about them and the outcome is one of the most powerful and hope inspiring there is. I brake every single time when watching sequence when Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free - it is a powerful film making so say the least.<br/><br/>Overall, No.1 at IMDb Top 250 says a lot - this is a movie that stays with you and inspires you not to lose hope. It is flawlessly paced - at running time 2 h 20 min it never drags - it should be studied at film making universities HOW to create a film with no women characters, when action takes place inside the prison and there isn&#39;t mainstream action at all. Good things never get old, and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is one the fainest examples."
671,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"One of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen you just have to see it for yourself and you will know why, However if you&#39;re a big Sly or Arnold fan, you may not like it as it doesn&#39;t have any exploding cars, plus it has a lot of dialogue and some words with more than two syllables"
4080,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is quite simply the best film of all time. The film really sets of the groundbreaking genre of mafia/gangster films. <br/><br/>This film follows the New York mafia family in 1940&#39;s America as they try protect and build upon their empire whilst challenged by rival families. <br/><br/>This film is filled with outstanding performances, Al Pacino plays the role of the son who is against everything the family stands for but throughout the film slowly finds himself going against everything he believed in and consequently joining their ways and eventually becoming the leader of the family after Don Corleone&#39;s life comes to an end. <br/><br/>This film marks the start of Al Pacino&#39;s outstanding career and is still one of his best performances to this day. Marlon Brando playing the main role as Don Corleone in the film is at his very best and absolutely deserved his Academy Award for his performance. He gives a real sense of realism to the film and shows us the intelligence and pride in the mafia rather than the criminality and violence people stereotype the mafia with. John Cazale, who plays Fredo, gives the performance of a lifetime as he plays the runt of the family, lacking intelligence and bravery and will never live up to his father&#39;s aspirations for him. He always lives in the shadow of his two brothers and is seen as inferior to them throughout, Cazale shows psychological realism as we see his struggle to come to terms with his inferiority. <br/><br/>This film portrays the Mafia in a way which we find ourselves sympathizing with the characters despite their criminal antics. Which is astonishing to see due to the severity of their crimes. <br/><br/>Many films such as Donnie Brasco, Casino and Goodfella&#39;s have tried to replicate the outstanding way in which the mafia is portrayed in this masterpiece but no film has ever matched up.<br/><br/>With unforgettable quotes and scenes, you will never watch a film so compelling in your life. <br/><br/>With a mixture of outstanding acting, directing, writing and music this is an all time classic. The defining film of Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s career. The only film that could ever compare : Part II.<br/><br/>A truly unmissable film."
2345,tt0068646,The Godfather,One of the best films! Probably the best gangster - mafia drama of all time!
536,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"In my personal view, any person in the world who understands English, would never say some thing wrong about this movie. If some does understands English and still says something wrong about this movie, it means he has not seen the movie. If some one understands English and has seen this movie as well, and still he says something bad about this movie, it means he has a really bad taste regarding movies or he does not know what a movie is. (According to me, these kind of people should be hanged to death) This movie has changed the life of thousands of people around the world.

457,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"&#39;The Shawshank Redemption&#39; is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film. Every other &quot;great film&quot;, or any film for that matter has it&#39;s pros and cons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it, very few against it. While I feel there are films out there with better pros; the pro to con ratio of &#39;The Shawshank Redemption&#39; out-stands any other film film ever produced. <br/><br/>I can&#39;t begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously the performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary. The cinematography, in particular, struck me. Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing. <br/><br/>I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made. This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema."

It is never boring. All of the hints that lead to the finale is absolutely genius, and the attention to detail is perfect. The third act is the best of all time. Roger Deakins gives one of his more subtle works, and it plays out beautifully. The dialogue is perfect, and you deeply care about the characters."

119,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie.  Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen.  Others are action junkies.  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not &quot;get&quot; this film, and that&#39;s too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.<br/><br/>At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people.  That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly.  It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray.  But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done.  And THAT is filmmaking at its finest.  Not a game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled."
3950,tt0068646,The Godfather,Fine if no one is saying anything I will this movie is overrated I understand why people THAT time (1970s) liked it back then it was something new and probably the most realistic movie they got back THEN but honestly there is SO MANY movies that are WAY better though I do understand why MEN liked it but honestly I&#39;ve been watching movies from a very young age and this movie wasn&#39;t even mid it was low the idea is SO basic and old and yeah you will say it&#39;s an old movie in the 70s and that&#39;s why you need to let it go you just like it because it old and old fashioned how about you move on from OH THOESE WERE THE GREATER DAYS and start get nostalgic people who are like this need to move to actually better movies with better plot and actually more realistic in OUR time and honestly it was SO misogynistic and I just lost 3 hours of my life in trash.

2699,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota&#39;s elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you&#39;ve got The Godfather, the &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it&#39;s no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola&#39;s direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn&#39;t really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don&#39;t bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando&#39;s largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando&#39;s sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it&#39;s legend."

583,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This is one of my favourite films ever. Why? Well a lot of reasons really. But mostly because of the plot. It contains just about everything needed for a film to really work like art. The actors are superb (note: Freeman - why he didn&#39;t receive an Oscar for this one, I&#39;ll never understand). The story is great, and written by my all time favourite writer - Stephen King (Misery, Dolores Claiborne, The Shining, Carrie and more), which are all among my absolute top films. Try them out. I promise you all several great movie-moments."
4735,tt0068646,The Godfather,"When you want to see a good movie, you have to see this one. The script, the actors, just whole the film is incredible.  It takes about three hours but it&#39;s done before you know. Everyone I know loved it, and I know many people."
5641,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I watched it when I was 13 years old. No one asked me to do so. I loved it and kept watching it for 30 times in 30 days. I have a top ten list, The Godfather 1972 is out of the list. On the top. Nothing can come close to it."
2296,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It&#39;s very easy to let high expectations get the better of you when you watch a film. Maybe the film is perfectly fine, but nowhere near as good as you had expected, and so you are left with a bitter taste in your mouth when sans these expectations you would have had a fine few hours (looking at you, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Or maybe your expectations are simply too high for any film to realistically meet. The Godfather could have easily fallen into one of these two categories. After all, when it comes to films that carry high expectations, it&#39;s hard to top The Godfather. And yet, in spite of all that, the film is still a masterpiece that enthralled me for all 3 hours of its runtime. Trust me when I say this film is one of those classics that has earned its legendary reputation. Almost everything about in this film is done to great effect. Even things I don&#39;t usually notice (unless they&#39;re really bad) like the editing and the sound design are done masterfully, the score is not only beautiful but the film knows when not to use the score and let the tension build, and of course you can&#39;t talk about The Godfather without talking about the legendary director and cast. With Francis Ford Coppola at the helm of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duval, James Caan, John Cazle and Diane Keaton, and an amazing story on top of that it really shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone this film is as good as it is. There are so many more things I could say to sing this films praises, and so many more things that deserve praise, so many amazing scenes and so many memorable moments/lines, but really, you should just see the film yourself.<br/><br/>10/10"

The thing I&#39;m getting at is this: my expectations from movies are varied and very individual to each movie, and they are influenced by a lot of things. The Godfather is one of the movies I&#39;ve been hearing about for years now, knowing how immensely impactful it is on cinema. Friends, fellow film lovers, one of my sisters - everyone just kept telling me I HAVE to watch it, a feeling that has only gotten stronger after watching Apocalypse Now - a great war movie by the same director - but me going from bottom to top on this poster meant not getting to watch this one for years, and I knew that when I started this whole journey. Now I&#39;m here, though, after my rewatch to this film. Let&#39;s get into it.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a 1972 film by Francis Ford Coppola, based on Mario Puzo&#39;s book by the same name. The movie follows the Corleone family, an Italian mafia family in 1940&#39;s New York. The movie tells their story throughout a decade or so, with special focus on Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the least involved in the family business of all the men of the family, and the way he gets pulled into the conflict - and the family business - when things go awry, and a bloody war starts with another big mafia family.<br/><br/>The first thing to catch my attention here is the cinematography. Many a film nerd have talked about how each shot here is soaked with shadows, and how the inner mafia world contrasts with the innocent, well-lit exterior in scenes like the famous wedding in the first act. They have crowned the cinematographer, Gordon Willis, as &quot;prince of darkness&quot;, and analyzed each scene down to the last frame. Honestly, though? This is just, simply put, one the best-looking movie I&#39;ve watched in quite a while, easily. It&#39;s not just the lighting - it&#39;s the composition, the attention to the background, the color grading. I think about a beautifully shot scene at a funeral, with flowers in the background, I recall another in a little garden where oranges grow, and so many more pop to mind. Even supposedly simple shots, with just one or two characters and very simplistic background, can become hellish, desperate, soaked in grief of sorts. The movie really does a great job on that front.<br/><br/>The dialogue is very iconic, too, with many lines popping up when looking back at the movie. It&#39;s not just about being quotable, referenced endlessly and everywhere - it&#39;s about the film&#39;s ability to make dramatic impact. When looking at today&#39;s mainstream cinema (and cinema in general, throughout history, though I do feel like in recent years it&#39;s been more of a phenomenon), so many movies are trying to pull off badass moments of dialogue, to be cool, to ingrain a moment into our brains, but when they have nothing up their sleeve it just makes everything cringy, tryhard, stiff (side note: you&#39;re more than welcome to read my latest film review, for The Dark Knight Rises, an example to such a movie). The Godfather manages to pull off so many great lines of dialogue with a lot of dramatic impact, and almost effortlessly at that - much of that thanks to actors such as Al Pacino and Marlon Brando, who deliver very good, natural performances here. Showing these underworld interactions in a movie and making it believable, well-written enough to not break the immersion - well, that takes some skill, and the people who were working on this movie definitely had it, and it shows.<br/><br/>In movies, and generally media, of this sort - you know, crime-centered stories that depict characters who get sucked into the underworld - the world of crime often seems alluring, luxurious, brimming with wealth. Even safer than the &quot;ordinary&quot; world, at times. But sooner or later it is revealed, in many of these stories, that the characters have been dancing on thin, thin ice for this whole time, and their bloody dance can make them fall right into cold, hellish depths just like that, swallowed by their greed and the violence of the underworld. The way that even in their happiest days they need to look over their shoulder, the tension between this deep, familial, loving bonds, that mix in the so-called &quot;business&quot; so much that it&#39;s hard to understand if the family is the goal and the crime is the means, or if it&#39;s vice versa - there&#39;s something very tragic about it all. I think that the movie captures this very well. We care for the characters, and when they fall into the dark pits of the underworld it has an impact, especially when we know that things could&#39;ve been so much simpler had they chosen another path. And besides, just the tragedy of being born into it, being connected to evil acts by blood, knowing you could never escape your name, creates this dark feeling of determinism, dark fate. Works well.<br/><br/>Pretty much every male character here behaves like douchebags at least in some instances - violence, self-importance, misogyny, you know the drill. It&#39;s easy to notice that these characters act in ways that are not only illegal, but are also often immoral, or at least morally problematic. Despite that, we also get to see their more caring side, the bonds they have with each other, the love and respect they have for Vito. I feel like we&#39;re shown different facets in ways that really make the main characters feel more human, even though they&#39;re knee-deep in the crime world. And kudos to the actors, again, for delivering characters with complexities in a convincing, immersive way, especially Brando as Vito, who steals the focus of the plot even when he&#39;s off-screen. My point being: the characters here are written in a way that reveals both their humanity and their darker sides, which makes us relate to them just enough to be emotionally invested, and emphasizes the tension between those two sides. I like the movie&#39;s approach to that.<br/><br/>The pacing is also solid, which is not to be taken for granted - pacing can be a challenging thing to manage with movies of this sort, that let their plot unfold throughout a decade or so, and a pretty long runtime, too. With The Godfather there&#39;s almost always something interesting going on, some tension, this pulling sensation that makes me want to discover more. I wouldn&#39;t say that this movie has kept me at the edge of my seat constantly, but I would say that the pacing here is indeed solid, especially in the final act. This movie is a bit of a slow burn, in some ways, but it&#39;s always in escalation, always raising the stakes and making the characters change. I will also say here that the soundtrack is very solid as well - it just works well when it comes to creating an atmosphere, and it&#39;s used pretty well. It&#39;s not my favorite soundtrack ever by any means, but it&#39;s recognizable, echoing the tragic themes this movie is focusing on, and it usually hits the spot.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a tragic portrayal of a crime family who&#39;s getting sucked into a bloody war, where no one can stay uninvolved, no family member can step aside and let everything drift away. It&#39;s the best-looking film I&#39;ve seen in quite a while, and it shows characters from every angle, the loving and caring one as well as the harsh, violent, ruthless one. A rise and a fall, a fall and a rise - no stability can be expected when living on the thin ice. The tension between business and family here, and the alluring luxury of the underworld, made me think of Breaking Bad, which, though maybe anachronistic, is a big compliment when it comes from me. I&#39;m feeling an 8.1/10 on this one. A very good movie indeed."
473,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This movie was far ahead of its time. It had the best picture, soundtrack, brilliant acting, decriptive characters, masterful storyline as in example illustrated the ideal prison life to the bone,  and was first of its kind to come out with a unbelivable(shocking) ending. If you haven&#39;t watched this movie yet, you are depriving your eyes from the &quot;amazing&quot; it craves. The ending is so beautiful, one can&#39;t dare to imagine."
4733,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One of the best movies ever made! Best actors; great scenes, direction, location, production! We need more directors, actors, &amp; producers like this to return to the US, operating on all cylinders! The story, although disturbing &amp; bloody and vaguely based on true stories related to the mafia/cartel is so true to life."
4982,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is the most influential American film that has ever been released.<br/><br/>So there isn&#39;t much more that I can say to really emphasize how much you should watch this film.<br/><br/>An epic film telling the tragic story of the Corleone family who is one of the biggest mafia families set in the 1940s to the 1950s.<br/><br/>A film that really goes deep into the topic of family, power structure and being placed at the head of your family&#39;s empire without a choice.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are the two stand out characters.<br/><br/>Without even having any sort of back story you can see the type of power Vito Corleone holds among the family and to see the transition of Michael Corleone become a major head of his family despite originally wanting to have nothing to do with his family&#39;s business.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a tale that is engrossing from start to finish even being at almost 3 hours long."
2601,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving &quot;business&quot; guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie&#39;s (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.<br/><br/>The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the &quot;greatest films of all time&quot;. Even though I&#39;ve given it a 10, I wouldn&#39;t put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I&#39;ve given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it&#39;s only because it&#39;s so highly regarded--if you&#39;ve not experienced the film yet. I think it&#39;s a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.<br/><br/>Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you&#39;ve watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, &quot;Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?&quot; The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film&#39;s appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.<br/><br/>But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather&#39;s brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi&#39;s violence is effective, setting that knob to &quot;11&quot; doesn&#39;t make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.<br/><br/>To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of &quot;oscillating&quot; dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.<br/><br/>But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It&#39;s tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota&#39;s score.<br/><br/>Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis&#39; unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you&#39;re looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) &quot;zoom out&quot; from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it&#39;s a long monologue from a minor character).<br/><br/>Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn&#39;t believe it&#39;s something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.<br/><br/>If you haven&#39;t seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the &quot;greatest film of all time&quot; hype. That&#39;s only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you&#39;ll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood&#39;s more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it&#39;s as much a &quot;historical family saga&quot; as a crime or gangster film."
5227,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather. You just say that name and most people get a picture of Vito or Michael in their head. They can literally see the shady suits and the corrupt deals. This movie defined a generation, people who were kids when it came out wear the badge with honor. I, for one, was not blessed with that gift, but I did grow up with this movie. I convinced my parents to get this movie for me when I was about 12-years old. I sat down and watched it so intently, that for years if someone talked about a scene and didn&#39;t say the words just right, I could correct them and tell them down to about the minute where to find that scene in the movie. I would go to Jr. High and talk like I was Vito Corleone, and I&#39;d recruit friends to be in my family. We became a tight bunch because of that fact, so basically, what I&#39;m saying is, The Godfather is responsible for a lot of joy in my life. One of the top 10 greatest movies of all time."
3691,tt0068646,The Godfather,"A cinematic masterpiece from director Francis Ford Coppola. One of the greatest movies ever made. Marlon Brando made Don Vito something we rarely see in movies: realistic anti-hero, villain with million of verges. It&#39;s also story about how one good man (war hero) become a genius of a criminal world. Every scene was directed with the soul. Combined with Part II. In this movie perfect everything: perfect characters, adapted screenplay, and original soundtrack. Film about relationship between family members, loyalty, honor in life of gangsters and revenge. The Godfather did for gangster movies what Alfred Hitchcock did for Thriller (Suspense) genre."

2148,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo&#39;s best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss.<br/><br/>Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel before it gained popularity for the price of $80,000. Studio executives had trouble finding a director, as their first few candidates turned down the position. They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular Vito and Michael. Filming was done on location and completed earlier than scheduled. The musical score was composed primarily by Nino Rota with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.<br/><br/>The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and Part III (1990).<br/><br/>The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute."
3281,tt0068646,The Godfather,"If only this film was not supposed to be the greatest movie ever made...<br/><br/>Had an interesting start.
But then it took too long for me to get invested in the characters.
And it kind of tries to glorify crime and criminals.<br/><br/>So yeah this movie needs lots of patience. Maybe when it was made it was different and trendsetter.<br/><br/>Oh. The expectations."
4217,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Instead of focusing on everything that is extraordinary about The Adoptive parent, a much simpler path for me to judge its quality is on what is awful about it. Each film has something that I don&#39;t care for about it, however I can genuinely say that I wouldn&#39;t change anything about The Back up parent. There is nothing powerless about it and nothing that emerges as terrible. That is the reason it gets ten out of ten. <br/><br/>This is one of those movies that made me ask why I hadn&#39;t seen it prior. The acting from everybody included is extraordinary, Marlon Brando runs over superbly as the leader of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are astounding as his children. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is additionally extremely essential, bringing back memories of the film each time I hear it. The plot must be fabulous for it to get ten out of ten, and it will be, its a long way from unsurprising and the film is the meaning of an awesome epic. <br/><br/>The film is really stunning in the way every demise happens momentarily, and as it compasses ten years such a variety of distinctive things happen and each moment of it is extraordinary stimulation. It&#39;s a well- made and enthralling film that is just the first piece of a set of three, yet it remains all alone as a superb film in its own particular right. On the off chance that you haven&#39;t seen it, what are you holding up for? This was one acclaimed film that didn&#39;t baffle."

What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."
2644,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Incredible!! With the epic soundtrack, characters, plot, casting, and directing this movie has to be considered THE best of all time. Although it is one of many Francis Ford Coppola masterpieces, this movie stands apart from the others. By telling the Corleone story from the inside of the family and mafia, viewers easily identify with and care about the characters. The cinematography is amazing too, and some of the shots and scenes from this movie can be considered the best of any movie throughout time. You can see IMDb&#39;s 9.2 rating of The Godfather and hear about the movie as often as you want, but until you experience the power of this film yourself, it will be impossible to grasp the importance of the movie to cinema. Although this movie is from the early 70s, it is by no means dated. Michael Corleone is my personal favorite character of all time, and the chance to see James Caan, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and John Cazale work together is unforgettable. Nobody could&#39;ve known that Marlon Brando, with two cotton balls, would create the most famous voice in cinematic history."

Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.<br/><br/>Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.<br/><br/>A masterpiece."
4573,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Incoming hot take: It&#39;s good.<br/><br/>I watched &quot;The Offer&quot; a few weeks back and since then decided that it&#39;s high time that I watched &quot;The Godfather&quot; again, for the first time in what must be a couple of decades. It&#39;s a really perfect balance of interesting performances and a gripping story.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) turns down the opportunity to move his crime family into the lucrative narcotics business post-WW2. An attempt on his life leads to his hot-headed son, Sonny (James Caan) taking temporary control of the organisation whilst consiglieri Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) tries to stop the escalation to all out war. Vito&#39;s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino) a decorated war hero, commits a murder on behalf of his brother and then heads to Italy to avoid retaliation.<br/><br/>You almost don&#39;t need to watch &quot;The Godfather&quot; again, so many of its lines, moments and scenes are iconic to all of pop culture that they are embedded in the consciousness. Brando is never quite as broad as the impressions make out to be, and though some lines are difficult to hear, there&#39;s a subtly to it that can be overlooked. It&#39;s mostly Michael&#39;s story though, as he rises to become the new Don from not being in the family business at all at the opening wedding. For me, this is still Al Pacino&#39;s best performance. Visually it&#39;s excellent, the score is another iconic aspect of the enterprise. It&#39;s just a great film. A perfect blend of commercial and artistic endeavours.<br/><br/>Being slightly more critical, it does introduce us to lots of characters and later refer to them by name only, eventually though these problems ease out and you learn who to focus on. John Cazale is slightly underutilised, but he would return for a bigger role in the sequel.<br/><br/>Speaking of, looking forward to rewatching that second film at some point soon."
4868,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I&#39;m personally not that into gangster or mafia movies, I&#39;m one of the rare people you will meet to tell you that Goodfellas is kinda overrated, and far from Scorsese&#39;s best film. There are however a few exceptions to that, and on the very top of that list, is Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s The Godfather.<br/><br/>This movie is pretty much flawless. The cinematography is fantastic, the music is beautiful and fits with the italian mafia theme perfectly, the performances from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in particular are among the greatest ever captured on film, and the film received 9 Academy Award nominations with 3 wins, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Brando.<br/><br/>10/10 across the board for me, and may be the undisputedly greatest film of all time."
252,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I finally watched The Shawshank Redemption and I agree that it is an excellent film. The pacing, directing, and storyline, holds interest throughout, along with a superb supporting cast, and a very moving ending.<br/><br/>The main character is Andy played by Tim Robbins who is imprisoned for the murder of his wife. Later on in the movie, the evidence comes out that he is truly innocent. However The Shawshank Redemption sends a powerful message that it doesn&#39;t matter whether you are innocent or not inside Shawshank penitentiary. This is because the prison is run by a sadistic and corrupt staff. In this facility, you must use all of the intellect you can, both book smarts, and street smarts to not only stay alive, but prevent yourself from going insane within the system.<br/><br/>Andy befriends &quot;Red,&quot; a fellow inmate, played by Morgan Freeman in another great performance. He teaches Andy street smarts of survival within Shawshank&#39;s hell-hole. Andy, an experienced banker with a master ability for finance and book learning, manipulates the prison officials to get funds to set up a &quot;basic skills&quot; learning facility within the prison&#39;s library. Red helps him organize this, and HOW Andy sets up the funding is really an amazing part of the movie. Another inmate is the head librarian, known as &quot;Brooks,&quot; who delivers many amazing scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>What is special about The Shawshank redemption is how the characters, especially Andy and Red, are able to use their inner abilities to rise above the conditions of the prison and the people who run it. There are some disturbing and violent images that show the harsh realities of prison life, such as fighting, and often getting beaten by the staff or punished for very small offenses and a lot of times for no reason at all. The Shawshank Redemption shows the abuse of power by prison authorities and how the inmates have to have the courage to rise above this abuse, because they need to do this, in order to keep living. They learn that failure to get this courage and survival skills from other inmates will destroy them. A great quote in this film is. &quot;you can get busy living, or you can get busy dying.&quot; Another interesting experience is how Red often wonders how at his advancing age he will be able to survive outside the prison if and when the parole board lets him go. An underlining message is that whether you &quot;get busy living or dying&quot; you become so accustomed to life in a controlling environment that the outside world, and the struggles, to reach it, to become physically and mentally &quot;free&quot; are an enormous challenge requiring great perseverance and the ultimate in determination.<br/><br/>As good as this movie is, I was looking for that spark of magic that would put it at and over the top of all time classic films. However, I think that there are some outstanding prison movies that are just as good if not better than The Shawshank Redemption. Watch the Sean Penn Movie, &quot;Bad Boys&quot; for an outstanding portrayal inside and outside a juvenile prison. (Interestingly, Clancy Brown, who plays the bad officer in &quot;Shawshank,&quot; is just as good as a prison bully in &quot;Bad Boys.&quot;) Another great movie is &quot;Midnight Express&quot; which is (although loosely) based on the real story of Billy Hayes who was arrested in Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish back to the USA in 1970. This is another amazing survival prison picture with an unforgettable musical score and some chilling moments.<br/><br/>I see The Shawshank Redemption equal to, but no better than &quot;Midnight Express&quot; or &quot;Bad Boys.&quot; This is NOT a criticism of a fine movie! I am only putting The Shawshank Redemption in strikingly similar prison survival pictures that don&#39;t get the same credit that this movie does. Call this movie the greatest ever, and you have to do the same for &quot;Midnight Express&quot; or &quot;Bad Boys.&quot; All three films have the same emotional impact. Another under rated movie that you should see is &quot;An Innocent Man,&quot; which is also similar to The Shawshank Redemption but is considered only above average.<br/><br/>The Shawshank Redemption is a great film for its time. But because of similarities to other similar prison pictures, I can&#39;t classify it as great for all time"
3435,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Of course, a million movies imitate all the superficial aspects, the mafia stuff that&#39;s become cliche, but they don&#39;t really try to make a movie like THE GODFATHER. Maybe they&#39;re just being realistic - not many people could pull off a movie that good. But still. Let&#39;s see some striving, people. True greatness has been proven possible. You&#39;ll never get it unless you try."
314,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"From the writing, direction, camera, and actors.... this is one of those films that seems almost like you have to watch it over and over. It reminds you never to give up, to figure a way out of your situation, to be patient.... the list truly goes on. Thank you for such an incredible film!"
5045,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I find it extremely disheartening that people would complain about the length of &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  Unlike most movies of the three hour duration, I find that when I view &quot;Godfather,&quot; not once do I look at my watch or think about how long it is.  And that is simply because it is the closest thing to perfection on  film that we have yet to see.  Never once do I question it when I see this ranked as the #1 film on various lists.  Coppola, despite a shaky career of hits and misses, created a structural story so memorable and unmatched that it must have the three hour length to fully develop into a nuanced story, setting the stage for its successors.  And I challenge anyone to find a more memorable screen performance than Marlon Brando.  So for those of you who don&#39;t like three hour movies, you&#39;d better stick to the 90 minute masterpieces like &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; and &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds.&quot; You&#39;ll probably understand them better."
4398,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a beautifully written piece about the inner workings of a mob family between 1945 and 1955. The main storyline is about a mob Don, Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, and his two sons, Sonny and Michael, played by James Caan and Al Pacino respectively. Michael starts out as an outsider, with no interest in joining the &quot;family business.&quot; The &quot;family business&quot; is a term that is used frequently and carries heavy significance. Whenever they talk &quot;business,&quot; they often use the phrase, &quot;It&#39;s not personal, it&#39;s just business.&quot; They use it to convince not only society and the surrounding people but also themselves that what they are doing isn&#39;t as violent as it actually is. Using the family business ideal and constantly reminding themselves that what they are doing is business, not extortion, racketeering, and murder, helps them to cope with the violence and the guilt that comes with such activities. <br/><br/>I think that one of the things that helps this movie along profusely is the acting of the mob members. The transformation of Michael portrayed by Al Pacino is the reason that this movie works. Michael starts out as a college kid with a girlfriend who wants nothing to do with the family business. He shows respect to his family, but declines interest in the illegal aspect of their business ventures. Once things start spiraling out of control, he proudly steps into any role they need him to fulfill, even if it means he has to leave the country for a few years. Once he returns, he continues to develop into a leader, with the calm contentions of his father and the intelligence and youth of a new generation, all the way until he replaces Vito as the Don of the Corleone family.<br/><br/>Coppola uses doors as a symbol of the clear separation between the men&#39;s &quot;family business&quot; and the women&#39;s family business. Whenever the men are about to discuss their ventures, they close the door to the outside world, both for security purposes and because they are the only ones who have the authority to make those decisions. While the men talk about that business, the women cook, clean, and tend to the younger children, clearly separated from the men&#39;s work, usually by a door.<br/><br/>The biggest key to being an effective don in a mob is being respectful. In the meeting of the five families, Don Vito swears on his grandchildren&#39;s life that he will not break the peace they have decided upon, and hugs the don who had his son killed. Seeing those two men hug even after they had each other&#39;s sons killed clearly indicates that respect is something that is vital in this criminal underworld. <br/><br/>One of the big moments in the movie is when Michael decides to do whatever is necessary for the family by agreeing to shoot Sollozzo in the diner. Michael changes his beliefs toward the family business in order to help his family. Later when their sister calls Sonny and says she&#39;s been beaten again, he rushes out the door without taking any bodyguards with him in order to protect and defend her. Later when the Corleone family is trying to buy the casino in Las Vegas, they ask Johnny Fontane to sign a contract to help their business, and he signs it without a second thought, because they are like family. Seeing these acts of family loyalty makes it clear that family is the one thing that people of this time believe in above all else.<br/><br/>One of the best things about the Godfather is since it was an ensemble movie with many stars and lead characters, there is a constant fear for the characters safety. In some movies, there are only one or two main characters, so you know that they aren&#39;t in any harm or real danger until the end of the movie, and even then rarely. In The Godfather, several of the Corleone family members, rival members, and family friends die throughout the movie, even some of the big stars. Don Vito gets shot, survives, and then suffers a fatal heart attack later. Sonny gets gunned down in the street by a rival family. A supposed family friend, Sal Tessio, tried to set up Michael in a deal with the Barzini family, and they kill him. Seeing important named characters die throughout the movie makes it seem more realistic and more fearful of any dangerous situation they talk about.<br/><br/>The biggest underlying struggle throughout the entire film is corruption versus loyalty and trying to make the best choices for the long term that will benefit you and that you can be at peace with. Corruption of loyalties, business matters, and family is rampant throughout the film. Sal Tessio gets paid by Barzini to try and get Michael killed. Carlo, Corinne&#39;s husband, baited Sonny into the open so Barzini&#39;s men could gun him down. Even the Corleones are guilty of using corruption to their advantage: They murder and mutilate the prized horse of a filmmaker so Johnny Fontane can get a part in a movie. The internal struggle of each character trying to stay devoted to their family while staying on top in the business is enticing to be a part of for a few hours."
889,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It&#39;s a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That&#39;s what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It&#39;s also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.<br/><br/>I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn&#39;t mine, but I get it. If you haven&#39;t seen it, or haven&#39;t seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it&#39;s amazing."

3480,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather &quot;Don&quot; Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter&#39;s wedding. Michael, Vito&#39;s youngest son and a decorated WWII Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don&#39;s influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito&#39;s fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart."

4630,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Really it is a one of the awesome movie .super like Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.<br/><br/>John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.<br/><br/>The story of one man&#39;s reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.<br/><br/>Do not miss this film!"
1777,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I love this movie. It&#39;s the greatest movie I ever seen in my life. Every time I watch it I see something new. It has drama, action and even comedy. The story is great. It centers around the most powerful New York mafia run by The Godfather. It teaches you about family and betrayal, about life in general. All that Michael does is for his family. He even sacrifices his relationship with his girlfriend to protect his family. The movie is amazingly shot, giving it amazing light. The characters are bigger than life and played by some of the greatest actors to ever live. The soundtrack is very good. All in all is must see."
2087,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a real masterpiece directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola. The screenplay, which is written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, is just perfect. All the actors did their best, which actually result in memorable performances. Marlon Brando was excellent. Regardless of the fact that The Godfather was one of his first movies Al Pacino was very good. The Godfather is one of the movies that make me love the cinema."
1758,tt0068646,The Godfather,"From the opening credits, you become completely immersed in the world of the Godfather. One of this film&#39;s greatest strengths is the pure power of the culture surrounding it. When you watch it, you feel like the society and the people in have descended from generations of people who have been in the &quot;business&quot;.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing less than sensational and the music accentuates and complements the film beautifully.<br/><br/>Not much else can be said of perfection.<br/><br/>This film is a must-have for anyone who professes to watch movies and is a required viewing for cultural education."
632,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I had been meaning to watch this movie for a long time, but I got the chance only yesterday, when I watched it on HBO. I can only say that for eight years I had missed a chance to witness a brilliant work. Tim Robbins is really good, so is Morgan Freeman. But the movie is not about any central character. The movie as a whole is devastatingly perfect. I saw Forrest Gump and thought it was awesome, deserving of the Oscar. But eight years since, I have to change my mind..."

701,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This is one of the best movies about &quot;friendship&quot; I&#39;ve ever seen, also one of the best prison movies. I found it better than Robert Redford&#39;s &quot;CASTLE&quot;. Morgan Freeman was perfect as usual and I can say that Tim Robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. I wish this couple come together for another movie, the kind of it is not important I&#39;m sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. I watched most of the films of Morgan Freeman and I can say this was the best of his, normally he prefers to play in films like &quot;Seven&quot;,&quot;Kiss the girls&quot;,&quot;Along came a spider&quot;,... but I think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts..."
267,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I&#39;d never heard of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; when I tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around 1997 or so.<br/><br/>It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.<br/><br/>I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a &quot;sleeper,&quot; on DVD or cable or satellite.<br/><br/>My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Heat.&quot; I didn&#39;t see &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; until around 2000 or so, and didn&#39;t care for it much. A good year for films.<br/><br/>Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I&#39;ve gone back through), I suppose &quot;Shawshank&quot; will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making &quot;Hey, it&#39;s not all that!&quot; (That is, it&#39;s not all that good, it&#39;s lousy, it&#39;s overrated, etc.)<br/><br/>Whatever, it&#39;s a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.<br/><br/>(Ditto for &quot;The Big Lebowski,&quot; which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now it&#39;s a subject of festivals and midnight watchings, sort of like &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; once was. I saw &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining.)<br/><br/>For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after another, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score. Unforgettable."
4679,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an absolute masterpiece that continues to stand the test of time as one of the greatest films ever made. Released in 1972, this iconic crime drama offers a compelling narrative, impeccable performances, and a mesmerizing portrayal of power, loyalty, and family dynamics.<br/><br/>The film revolves around the Corleone family, led by the powerful Don Vito Corleone, played flawlessly by Marlon Brando. Brando&#39;s portrayal of the patriarch is nothing short of legendary, capturing the essence of a complex character torn between tradition and the evolving world around him. His commanding presence and nuanced performance earned him an Academy Award, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>The Godfather boasts a stellar ensemble cast, with remarkable performances by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. Each actor brings their A-game, immersing the audience in a world of crime, power struggles, and the intricate workings of organized crime families.<br/><br/>Coppola&#39;s direction is masterful, showcasing his keen eye for detail and his ability to create an immersive cinematic experience. The film&#39;s pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to become fully absorbed in the narrative and the richly developed characters. The script, co-written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, is a work of art, filled with memorable dialogue and profound insights into the human condition.<br/><br/>One cannot discuss The Godfather without mentioning its iconic score, composed by Nino Rota. The haunting melodies perfectly complement the film&#39;s atmosphere, adding depth and emotion to pivotal scenes. The combination of visuals, performances, and music creates an unforgettable cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>The Godfather is not just a gangster film; it is a powerful exploration of family, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of power. It delves into the moral complexities of its characters, forcing viewers to question their own sense of right and wrong. The film&#39;s themes and narrative continue to resonate with audiences, cementing its status as a timeless classic."
781,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Good acting from all concerned carries the rather simplistic and obvious storyline beyond the saccharine, but the villains are really predictable in their villany and the storyline, while initially moving and affecting, seems forced and unreal once you step back from Robbins and Freeman&#39;s performances.<br/><br/>In other words, a high impact movie that rapidly loses credibility with considered thought after viewing. Far more worthwhile, though, than many other similarly stretched dramas and by no means a failure. But by no means in the top rank of movie making."
3865,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Why is this so overrated? The wedding sequence is so dull ,it made me bored.Come on the editor has done an ugly job.This movie could well be in 130-150 minutes.An overrated movie that takes too much time.Believe me skip this one,it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.The movie stands to its hype."
1727,tt0068646,The Godfather,"When the Godfather was released in 1972, the golden age of Hollywood was long over. Regardless, this film managed to recall that era while at the same time taking advantage of the ever changing times. This film is darker and more grittier than the films of the thirties and forties as such melancholy was starting to become more common in movies. It definitely didn&#39;t forget its roots however. The popular film noir style is very evident in this film: not just in the lighting but in the dark subject matter and often bleak themes. And the themes of the movie are indeed bleak. In fact, as people are shot, blown up, and have revenge acted upon them, an inexperienced movie viewer might wonder what the point is. The point is, under the violence and hate, there is a wealth of good: total justification for the mayhem. The Mafia may be murderous and revengeful, but they have values, possibly even more values than normal, law biding citizens.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando gives a breathtaking performance as Don Vito Corleone, a man who is vicious and harden, yet you learn to care for the guy and his family enough so that you eventually root for them every time they get their own way. Al Pacino also gives a great performance as Vito&#39;s son Michael, who is different from Vito in many ways. As we learn early on, he could care less about his family&#39;s business yet we know he will most likely be shoved into it eventually. We will then learn if he is able to control his family or if he will develop a lust for power and revenge that will cause him to fail altogether. Questions like this are what keep the film interesting and moving forward.<br/><br/>The well orchestrated characters also help the plot along and at no point do they seem unrealistic: even when they make drastic choices. And this is important since this is a very character driven film. And that&#39;s just one of the many strengths seen here. All great films have multiple strengths and this movie is no exception. Many crime films were made before this film as well as after it. The ones that came before were sometimes weighed down with Hollywood glamor while the ones that came after it were often all flash with no substance: relentlessly violent with no reward in the end for the viewer. The Godfather dodges those weaknesses and it also avoids being pretentious and overblown. Just one of the many things that make The Godfather the best movie of the seventies and possibly the best of all time."
237,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Ok, so this isn&#39;t exactly a bad film, but it&#39;s extremely hard to see why it holds the no.2 position in the top 250 films. The acting is fine, the twist is gratifying (if a little predictable) and some of the shots are fantastic. However, the film is let down by unrealistic dialogue, especially on the part of Freeman&#39;s character, who does not seem able to construct a sentence without using a string of metaphors and similes.<br/><br/>The prison warder is a one-dimensional villain with very little allure - we, the viewers, are not credited with much intelligence. Because he is a villain, it therefore follows that he must a be a Nazi, no? Cue references to book-burning etc. Furthermore, the portrayal of Tim Robbins&#39; character as Christ is slightly offensive (check out the shot in which he is shown with his arms thrown up to heaven).<br/><br/>In true Hollywood style, there seems to be about five &#39;endings&#39; - when we think that the excitement (or otherwise) is over, another sequence is tagged onto the end. Despite some fairly violent scenes, life inside Shawshank seems actually rather appealing - a library, plenty of time outside the cells. This, combined with the film&#39;s massive length, means that for my mind, The Shawshank Redemption merits only a 6/10."
1883,tt0068646,The Godfather,"If there was a zero out of 10, that&#39;s what I&#39;d give it.<br/><br/>I know so many people hear the movie title, &quot;The Godfather&quot; and automatically feel like praising that movie, that whole trilogy, to the high heavens. Well, I don&#39;t care if it was made well...apart from how it was made, the movie was bad and I&#39;m still upset that my philosophy teacher made me suffer through the whole trilogy. Boring...slow...just plain snooze-ville.<br/><br/>I&#39;m probably going to have an angry mob coming after me for speaking of the movie this way, but it&#39;s my opinion...and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone in feeling this way."

This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film.

That the actors are very well. The problem is that it does not catch me. He can not hook me. When it seems that it is going to put interesting Al Pacino goes away of trip and does things that do not make sense and that do not come to story.<br/><br/>The photography is spectacular, such as art, makeup, costumes, the overall setting is fine. The actors also do very well.<br/><br/>The management however, although it takes well the tone, but is that to my Coppola I do not like, I am sorry, but I do not like how it directs. He can not catch me in any way. Neither with history nor with beauty, which does not exist, nor with plans. I do not like anything that is a film shot basically in the foreground. Of course it has open plans, but all the conversations are in the foreground, there is nothing staging. The character of Al Pacino seems totally inconsistent to me, as soon as it says white makes black. It is the most variable character of the whole cast.<br/><br/>Yet this is the best of the three, because the two is worse and the three is worse still in every way."

Meticulously chosen camera angles and stunning cinematography capture the essence of the characters and the environment they inhabit.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the brilliant ensemble cast contributes to the film&#39;s exceptional quality. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the powerful leader of the mafia family.

His transformation throughout the film is fascinating to watch, showcasing Pacino&#39;s talent and versatility as an actor.<br/><br/>The plot of &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a true tour de force, filled with intrigue, betrayal, and loyalty. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Puzo, is a brilliant adaptation of the original novel.

2378,tt0068646,The Godfather,"When watching this film, you really can see and appreciate how many films that has come after take inspiration from this all-time classic. Francis&#39; direction is masterful in every way, Marlon Brando&#39;s method acting in this film is immaculate, to me, Brando is Vito Corleone, &quot;The Don&quot;, &quot;The Godfather&quot;"
1880,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather. So much praise has been showered upon it, forming a large mountain of critical excellence. It is almost difficult to quantify how many levels this movie succeeds on. I hesitate to even call this a &quot;movie&quot; because it is from the time when a movie was an artform. Sadly, these movies are now a dying breed. The Godfather is THE PINNACLE of excellence on the big screen. <br/><br/>You all know that it is a story of the Corleone Family, a large Sicilian Mafia syndicate living in New York and led by Vito Corleone, who is played perfectly by Marlon Brando (I will talk about this a bit later), a powerful Don who demands respect and friendship and offers favors in return. No movie has come close to this one in giving a portrait to organized crime. Not in terms of pure realism or insight, understand. Goodfellas, a great movie in its own right, is a much more realistic story of the way gangsters operate. The Godfather is a glorified Sicilian Mafia tale spun by Mario Puzo and later translated to film by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, showing the near fall from power of the family. <br/><br/>The Godfather portrays so many different moral questions and considerations: how can power corrupt a man, how things look from different perspectives, is a man allowed to live outside of society, can a man reject society without punishment and live by his own laws, should someone be true to their family or to society, and much more. The result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.<br/><br/>To be fair, a healthy portion of this movie&#39;s outward success is due to its acting. Never before and never again has there been such a powerful joint acting performance. It&#39;s almost insane to think about how amazing it was, how amazing and influential this entire movie is. Most great movies have one memorable acting performance, two if they are lucky. Four actors- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall- are best known for their work in the Godfather, the latter three using this title as a springboard to fame. All four acting performances, playing Vito, Michael, and Sonny Corleone plus the Consigliere Tom Hagen, are among the best ever. Along with this, Vito Corleone is probably the most prominent figure in the public&#39;s mind when it comes to movies. His raspy voice has become the stuff of legends, and has been imitated by almost everyone at one point or another. <br/><br/>Here I will explain why classic movies in general are far superior to today&#39;s critical masterpieces. Many people find the Godfather too slow for their tastes. While opinions are different and I do not get mad at people who find other great movies to be superior to the Godfather, people who ridicule this film to be outwardly slow quite frankly do not have long enough attention spans. This is an epic. we are talking slow corruption for maximum effect. Slow unfolding to make it seem more real, not sudden jerks of the plot but carefully constructed twists that are slowly built up and make perfect sense upon further thought. Not to mention that the cinematography is absolutely chilling. Watch the baptism scene and you will know what I mean.<br/><br/>This motion picture also features what is considered by many as the single most powerful scene in movie history- I won&#39;t spoil anything, but you will know it when you see it. Not to mention the wonderful soundtrack, an instantly memorable score that does a lot to help the film.<br/><br/>But by saying that I betray the true beauty of this film. The most prominent reason for this movie&#39;s place at the top of the all-time greats is that most movies have a few scenes that stand out when you remember them. Everybody immediately knows what they are afterward. Empire Strikes Back has the final battle with Vader. Rocky has the run up the steps. All of these are obvious. But, while perhaps the scene mentioned above is a bit more prominent, every single scene is done with such consistency and perfection. Coppola is simply a genius, or at least was in the 1970s. There are absolutely no hitches in the screenplay. Every scene is equally intense. But the paradox of this is that not only will you be hanging on to every word and totally absorbed into the story your first time, The Godfather gets better every time you watch it! The first time I saw this, I had not been as exposed to the greatest movies ever. I didn&#39;t truly understand all the moral depths of this story, but I still thought it amazing simply for the intensity of the scenes, plot, and the wonderful balance between the characters. However, after watching it dozens of times afterward I now understand all of the tiny stuff in the plot that make it what it truly is. All of the quotes and tiny little things about it are simply fantastic. Once again, in this space I cannot explain all of the greatness. I have not even gotten into the plot. To close, every single thing about this movie just absolutely screams quality. It&#39;s hard to find any significant weaknesses with this film, except that unlike the book it does not show the perspective from an outsider&#39;s point of view, such as the novel did with Kay Adams. But that is simply a tiny nitpick that we would not mention about any other movie. The effort put into everything else is what makes this visible. Everything else- perfection. If you have not seen The Godfather, DO SO NOW! It will stimulate your mind and emotions like no other movie ever filmed before. This is simply the quintessential film experience. 9.8.<br/><br/>&quot;I never listened to the big shots holding all the strings. But I hoped that someday you would be the one holding on the strings.&quot;"
690,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Watching this movie was a pleasure, the acting was outrageously good. A film without special effects and action every 5 minutes, just men in prison. All I can say is I would have loved this film to have been longer.<br/><br/>The acting from Morgan Freeman is second to none, he proves in this film why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors to grace our screens. <br/><br/>Anyone who hasn&#39;t seen this film needs too watch it straight after reading this review as it will change your opinion on a lot of other films."
764,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I&#39;ve watched The Shawshank Redemption at least 20 to 30 times, and I still don&#39;t know why it feels brand new every time. But it does. And every single time, when it ends-I break down. I&#39;ve watched hundreds of movies. Some I&#39;ve forgotten. Some stayed. But this one? Every single frame lives in my memory.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman&#39;s narration is pure poetry. Tim Robbins delivers a performance that can&#39;t be described in words. The writing, the direction-flawless. Adapted from Stephen King&#39;s novella &quot;Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, this film is a masterclass in storytelling. Stephen King has always been one of my favorite writers, and this adaptation proves how deeply his words can impact hearts.<br/><br/>There was a time in my life when I was broken. I thought I couldn&#39;t do anything with my life. That&#39;s when someone close to me said, &quot;Watch The Shawshank Redemption.&quot; And for the first time, I truly understood what hope means.<br/><br/>&quot;Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.&quot;<br/><br/>Sometimes the scenes and dialogues flash before my eyes and bring silent tears-
The rooftop beer scene, Morgan Freeman&#39;s voice, that music...
The Italian opera sequence when Andy locks himself in the warden&#39;s office-<br/><br/>&quot;I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don&#39;t want to know. Some things are best left unsaid.&quot;
We didn&#39;t understand the lyrics either. But that moment? We felt it. We lived it.<br/><br/>Then there&#39;s the unforgettable line-<br/><br/>&quot;Some birds aren&#39;t meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright.&quot;<br/><br/>And when Red says:<br/><br/>&quot;I guess I just miss my friend.&quot;<br/><br/>And finally, the most cathartic, soul-soothing moment when Red walks toward Andy in Zihuatanejo-<br/><br/>&quot;I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.&quot;<br/><br/>That scene... that music... that ocean.<br/><br/>I cry like a child. Every. Single. Time.<br/><br/>Some films are entertainment.<br/><br/>Some are emotion.<br/><br/>But The Shawshank Redemption is therapy for the soul.<br/><br/>It stays. Forever.<br/><br/>A timeless masterpiece.<br/><br/>The greatest film of all time.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Anyone who has ever felt lost. And anyone who needs to remember that hope still exists."
1077,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Tim Robbins delivers a powerful performance as Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully imprisoned but unbroken in spirit. Morgan Freeman&#39;s portrayal of Red, the narrator and Andy&#39;s closest ally, is heartfelt and deeply resonant. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is authentic and forms the emotional backbone of the story.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s narrative is both harrowing and uplifting, showcasing the triumph of the human spirit in the darkest circumstances. Darabont&#39;s direction, paired with Roger Deakins&#39; stunning cinematography and Thomas Newman&#39;s evocative score, creates an immersive experience that stays with viewers long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>With its poignant themes and unforgettable characters, The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless tale of hope and redemption, earning its place as one of the most cherished films of all time."
996,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Set in the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, this film delves into the complexities of redemption and the resilience of the human spirit. As we witness the journey of Andy Dufresne, a wrongfully convicted banker, and his friendship with Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding, we are drawn into a world of injustice, corruption, and ultimately, triumph.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s powerful storytelling, poignant dialogue, and breathtaking cinematography all contribute to its timeless appeal. The themes of hope, friendship, and the enduring human capacity for transformation are beautifully portrayed throughout the movie. The Shawshank Redemption does not shy away from the harsh realities of prison life, yet it also offers a glimmer of hope and redemption that shines brightly through the darkness.<br/><br/>Moreover, the film&#39;s iconic ending is one that has left a lasting impact on viewers, as it beautifully ties together the threads of the narrative in a truly unforgettable way. &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is a masterpiece that continues to be celebrated for its powerful storytelling, exceptional performances, and profound messages about the indomitable nature of the human spirit."
3703,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It&#39;s hard to find a moment in the film that isn&#39;t great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, &quot;The Godfather&quot; introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting."

3493,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I saw this film when it first came out. The book was a wildly popular best seller and everyone seemed to have read it. Trying to watch it the other day on TV I can&#39;t imagine anyone being able to follow it. Too many characters, too many subplots, and a very slow pace. I&#39;ve been watching films my whole life, and frankly I can&#39;t tell a good screenplay from a good performance from a good director. I do know that if I like the plot and the story engages me I&#39;ll be sure to like the movie. In the Godfather, scenes and characters come and go with no discernable point. I believe it&#39;s a lack of continuity or flow. Brando calls in Luca Brasi to keep an eye on someone. Luca is then seen in a small apartment in sideview getting dressed and then packing his gun. Then we see him go into a bar or restaurant that we&#39;ve never seen before. In a flash there&#39;s a knife in his hand and a wire around his throat. Apparently the character was introduced for the soul purpose of getting murdered. Pacino and Annie Hall are having a meal in what looks like a hotel. She has the most impossible hair style I&#39;ve ever seen in any movie bar none. They seem to be saying good bye and next we see Pacino walking down a street and into a dark building that we&#39;ve never seen before. He seems to get agitated and notices that in one room a half eaten sandwich on the table and the other rooms seem deserted. Running up and down corridors we now have no idea where he is or what he&#39;s doing. Suddenly he opens a door to what looks like a apartment and we see Brando lying on a hospital bed. Out of nowhere a nurse appears. The audience has no clue that this was a hospital. All it would take was a sign saying Emergency Room or Surgery. Then to involve the plot suddenly a dozen police cars appear in front of the building. The Captain says he was the one who told the guards and detectives to leave. And now he shows up with more. And all this is just a plot devise to have Pacino shoot him and the other mobster.
There are countless meetings in this film that could have easily taken place over the phone.
The cars, the costumes, and the scenes all seem very accurate. But this film is like an endless dramatic story without end. Doesn&#39;t it remind you too much of the ending in Apocolypse Now with the same director years later?"
3254,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people"
5559,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The story, goes up with my personal favorites like Scarface and The Shawshank Redemption. I watched this knowing it was a classic although this was better than I thought it would be. It&#39;s a must watch film that deserves the rating it has. I couldn&#39;t ask for a better movie than this slow, but perfect movie. It&#39;s a masterpiece. All of the characters have the perfect placement for this story. I&#39;m a big fan of crime films and Tv shows but I would watch this again. It&#39;s one of those movies that&#39;s makes you want to watch the sequels to see if it they can even compete with the first film."

4536,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;The Godfather&quot; is a visceral achievement in moviemaking and has a rightful place near the top of any list of the greatest films ever made. It seizes your attention, doesn&#39;t let go and takes you down the road promised to immigrants to America -- before taking a turn in which we confront the prejudices, mistrust and other roadblocks to the realization of their dreams, and how they went on to create success on their terms. But I have to put it near the top, not AT the top. That honor, on my list, belongs to &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; for a reason that it&#39;s hard to fault Coppola for. In &quot;The Godfather,&quot; I found Michael to be too far outside the family at the beginning of the movie. While not renouncing his father, Sonny or their enterprise, Michael seems to be more of an observer in an Army uniform with his white-bread girlfriend nearby than a family member PLANNING to immerse himself in the life his father and brother have chosen. Obviously Michael is drawn closer to his family as it becomes threatened with, then targeted by, violence. This is understandable but, to me, not foreshadowed by the life outside the family that he had chosen a few years earlier and seemed to be comfortable with. Of course, &quot;Part II&quot; gives a much fuller picture of how Michael got to where he was in running the enterprise, and heading the family. But we already know all we need to know about his motives and choices -- courtesy of &quot;The Godfather.&quot; This deeper, more realized character of Michael in &quot;Part II&quot; is the reason I rate it ahead of &quot;The Godfather&quot; -- but not by much."
3660,tt0068646,The Godfather,"What can I say?  I gave this thing a 1 because I honestly have never felt it was all that good.  I that saw the average was a 9  at the time I voted and I felt the dissenters should get some representation.  Brando isn&#39;t all that great in it.  I mean the thing is better than the average film (at least I&#39;m supposed to believe that), but 9 out of 10!?  No way.  Watch different movies.  In fact, watch other coppala movies.  I personally like &#39;The Outsiders&#39; and &#39;The Conversation&#39; better.  I find the story to be boring. I also think the structure of the script is a little too gimicky and amateurish.  I won&#39;t go into detail on this.  I will just say the thing left me dry."

5293,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Science fiction has been used as an indication of what the future may hold. At times, it was promising a utopian future, where scientific inventions and developments will make life so much better for &quot;humans&quot;, and machines (robots or, more generally, artificial intelligence) will be doing all the hard work. In other cases, however, it held a dystopian future, a warning message: technology can, and will, go wrong, and it will backfire, making our future full of destruction and agony."
2344,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Godfather is a groundbreaking and truly original piece of legendary film. With a cast of Oscar winners and awesome script, this film feels like you have been implanted into the scene of a real environment.

This film will never get old and I have the lost the count how many times I have watched the famous trilogy. Having owned this on Video, DVD and now Bluray, I can honestly say this will be in my collection for all time. True classic. <br/><br/>Peace and Blessings"
5374,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather was in 1973 a masterpiece and it still is and always will be.
This movie is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. <br/><br/>The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 45 years after its release. This movie has become a huge part of popular culture. Nino Rota&#39;s score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando&#39;s raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory. I can watch it over and over again with great pleasure...."
5127,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I admire the way authors and directors have fun with their readers and viewers by including scenes of great dramatic impact that are completely unexplained.<br/><br/>The Godfather has a perfect example in the &#39;horse&#39;s head in bed&#39; vignette. Implicitly we are required to believe that intruders armed with equipment to decapitate a stallion in the prime of life breezed into the stable block of what was presumably a fortified estate belonging to a movie mogul. Khartoum is somehow subdued without startling the other horses, stable lads, nightwatchmen, burglar alarms etc. His head is severed with stealth and silence. Then the slaughterers break into the movie producer&#39;s house and make their way to his bedroom, carrying the bleeding head with them. <br/><br/>After what has already been accomplished there&#39;s no problem in placing the head under the duvet at the foot of the bed and smearing blood all over the slumberer&#39;s pyjamas, hands and face without waking him. Whistling a happy tune, perhaps, the horse butchers, recruited from afar at a moment&#39;s notice, make their exit without difficulty or detection.<br/><br/>More nominations please for the most outrageous, impossible scene in a vaguely serious movie. I give this only 9.9 out of 10 to leave the slightest of breathing spaces for anything even more improbable."

56,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist&#39;s opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.<br/><br/>The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy&#39;s demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.<br/><br/>By creating the film&#39;s firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film&#39;s success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King&#39;s equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.<br/><br/>While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film&#39;s score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film&#39;s needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman&#39;s score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.<br/><br/>With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.<br/><br/>With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.<br/><br/>This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."

The performances in this movie by Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale are simply the best acting you will ever see...

3069,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The godfather is one of the greatest movies ever put together. Francis Coppola directed it in 1972 and integrated brilliant costumes, dynamic plot, detailed set, emotional sound track, and amazing actors involved in every scene the movie was one of the greatest successes of it&#39;s time and continues to remain a classic. I was born in 1990 and even though much as changed from when this movie was created to now, it is still a movie I can watch, enjoy, and appreciate because all those things listed above were spot on. This movie falls into multiple genres. Of those the largest is Crime Fiction. This genre crime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalizes crimes, their detection, criminals and their motives.<br/><br/>The costumes not only fit the time in which the movie was set for, but as each set ventured from one location to another they matched the costumes with the location and each scene appropriately. Additionally each character seemed to have their own sort of style they displayed through these costumes. If each character looked and sounded the same, a viewer could easily guess the character by the clothing they wore. <br/><br/>The plot engages the movie beautifully. From the beginning to end it leaves the viewer having a very direct and excellent understanding of what is happening and how it ties in to the main story. Even through watching the movie multiple times and knowing what happens I can still avoid anticipating what will happen next because it is so well established and drawn out. <br/><br/>Matching costumes, characters are captured in beautiful and well constructed sets. Viewers can actually watch the movie and though have never been to where the movie takes place, they are able to visualize and understand exactly where they are. This movie does an excellent job at not just focusing on where the action is but showing a larger portion of the picture to allow viewers to fill in any additional puzzle pieces that normally aren&#39;t formed but in some cases with some viewers is absolutely necessary to understand exactly where they are in each scene. <br/><br/>The sound track is very emotional. The symphony sound texture to the music allows background music to be applied to a scene and assist viewers to visualize what is going on and the emotions to be expected while the scene unfolds without requiring the use of additional vocals. This is exceptionally beneficial at the beginning and ending of each scene, as it displays the mood of the scene as it starts out or leaves a lasting effect of whatever just took place. <br/><br/>Last but not least the actors are the people who made the film what it was. Each role was very specific to the actor and very distinguished from one to another. In specific, the Don&#39;s sons Michael and Sonny, were extreme opposites. While one was very calm and easy going the other was very hot headed and gung hoe, looking for action and death to those who disagreed with him or stood up to the other family members. <br/><br/>All in all the movie was wonderful from beginning to end ultimately I would not change a single thing or think something could have been done to better the film. I definitely recommend anyone who has not watched this movie already to check it out!"

2619,tt0068646,The Godfather,"When people think of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, they usually think of the Mafia. But, as Entertainment Weekly noted, calling &quot;The Godfather&quot; a Mafia movie is like calling &quot;The Odyssey&quot; a guide to the Aegean Sea. This story of how the Corleone family rules New York with their own version of justice entails everything that makes movies good.<br/><br/>First, the opening scene. The shot of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) sitting in his chair petting his cat sets the Don up as a fatherly - but shady - figure. Then, you see Connie&#39;s (Talia Shire) wedding: the Corleones are not just a bunch of evil slime-balls. During the wedding, Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Wearing his military uniform, Michael looks like a handsome young man - possibly an allusion to how these people are adept at deceiving other people. At the wedding, Michael meets WASP-ish outsider Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who&#39;s naturally a little weirded out by the whole Mafia lifestyle - at one point, Michael has to tell her: &quot;That&#39;s my family, Kay. That&#39;s not me.&quot; The other two sons are Sonny (James Caan), the immature playboy, and Fredo (John Cazale), the loser. And there&#39;s also the adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), now a lawyer. After a trip to Hollywood where he unsuccessfully tries to get a producer to hire singer Johnny Fontane (who apparently was not really based on Frank Sinatra), we all know what Tom does with the horse.<br/><br/>A scene that did a really good job showing the break between 1st and 2nd generation Americans is the scene where Michael and Kay are Christmas shopping and &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&quot; is playing. Vito, as an immigrant, kept many of the traditions from his native country. Michael, born and raised in the US, certainly seems less Italian that his father.<br/><br/>Then, of course, Vito gets shot. After Michael gets revenge, he has to hide out in Sicily. While he&#39;s there...well, we all know what happens to Sonny. This prompts Vito to negotiate with the other families. But then, Michael turns out to be even more ruthless than his father.<br/><br/>Probably the most incredible scene is when Michael presides over the baptism of Connie&#39;s child. As soon as Michael &quot;renounces&quot; Satan, things get ugly. It basically says that every time that they say something holy, someone gets slaughtered.<br/><br/>All in all, Francis Ford Coppola created an inimitable cinematic masterpiece. And the sequel actually managed to equal the original."
2207,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is excellent! Probably the best I&#39;ve ever seen the props are very good minding the year it was released and the acting is out of this world. I&#39;ve read the book before and after watching the movie and I tell you the second time was much better! It was like the pictures the book tried to create came out alive as I&#39;ve seen the in the movie and it was really cool. They did put a lot of effort to this movie and it does pay off, as the scenery and the costumes and everything is so detailed. Of course the atmosphere of the movie is marvelous and really travels you back to the 40s spot on! You should totally see this movie, or better watch the whole trilogy. It is must!"
4330,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I could not maintain concentration throughout that film. When I heard it was on, I had high expectations. But I was throughly disappointed with how boring it was. I can&#39;t see how it was so good, it&#39;s just a load of Italians in America killing others. So boring I decided not to watch the last hour.<br/><br/>I will admit that the scene where the police captain and the drug guy was shot was quite good. The uncertainty of whether the gun is there or not is well produced and the effect with the white noise sounding like blood rushing through your ears was much more effective than the lame heart beats that you get it some films."

213,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This was my first time seeing this movie and I absolutely loved the movie. The drama and the story were really interesting of the whole movie. The violence was also very interesting of the film, it shows what it&#39;s like in prison after committing a crime and it shows what friendships in prison. It shows a lot of the film, just like escaping prison and Reuniting with a friend you have not seen in years. Very emotional and very good film, the director made this masterpiece well done and well made. The cast were really good and the acting was really impressive. We need another Shawshank redemption because the first one was amazing, also VERY RECOMMEND TO WATCH!"
5070,tt0068646,The Godfather,"There&#39;s no transition between Michael I (american hero, away of family business) and Michael II (Sicilian mobster). The shooting of Vito and the assassination of Sonny maybe explains a psychological turn to revenge (a little material showing the attachment between Michael and each of them would have been nice), but it&#39;s not enough for this transformation into a full-fledged mafia manager, interested in brothels and casinos. The character of Kay is pathetic, living among criminals and believing Michael&#39;s promises about changing his way of life. The whole movie is a collection of excuses to present sketches of violence."
5024,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Best film ever, amazing cast, Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation. The Godfather simultaneously along many roads: the socio-political analysis (the corruption of the authorities to the Cuban revolution), the Bildungsroman, the traditional gangster film, the protest film (especially in the third chapter), then go back where he started, more and more dark and bitter, closing in on itself. In full respect of the rules of tragedy, from the ancient Greeks to the New Hollywood. Ambassador of narrative classicism tinged cinefilia and spiced with personal experiences of its director, fascination with corruption and violence as inherent in the construction of power factors of both a family and a nation, conjunction of talents in adverse conditions with successful results and unexpected, the proof that even in the most unexpected place can wait a stainless classic, the Godfather is all that and the opportunity to see this in a movie theatre is a pending issue that many viewers or not viewers should have fulfilled."

It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.

1913,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a movie that just insists upon itself. From the very first scene, it insists upon itself. Every line of dialogue, every dramatic pause, every lingering shot-it all just insists upon itself. The cinematography? Insists upon itself. The characters? Insist upon themselves. The entire aura of the film? Pure insistence. It doesn&#39;t invite you in; it forces itself upon you, demanding admiration. But why? Because it insists upon itself. It&#39;s not subtle, it&#39;s not effortless-it&#39;s insistence, through and through. And that, quite frankly, is too much insistence for me. It insists upon itself."

1812,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather - Crime, Underworld Movie
Cast - Al Pacino, Marlon Brando<br/><br/>It is the highest-rated movie of all time. I found it realistic about underworld life. I have never seen any movie adapted from a very linear simple story but picturized with an awesome screenplay. The acting of every male character in this movie was top notch though all the female characters were more than dull. I liked the patience and planning of a godfather and how he deals with his enemies. There were some heavy dialogues delivered perfectly.<br/><br/>However, I did not like the story that much. It is more than good according to the year of its publication. But still, there is nothing to learn from this movie. This movie is enjoyable at the same time boring. The story is also predictable and there are some unnecessary scenes in the movie. I will recommend this movie as maybe this movie does not reside with my taste but others may like it so much. Finally, I found it overhyped and overrated.<br/><br/>Personal Rating - 6.5/10"
5102,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, is an iconic crime drama based on Mario Puzo&#39;s novel. The film centers around the Corleone family, led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), a powerful mafia boss in New York. At its core, the story explores themes of family, power, betrayal, and moral dilemmas.<br/><br/>The narrative primarily follows Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), Vito&#39;s youngest son, who initially wants nothing to do with the family&#39;s criminal enterprises. However, as the story unfolds, Michael becomes increasingly drawn into the mafia world. His transformation from an innocent outsider to a ruthless leader is depicted with remarkable depth, showcasing the complexities of loyalty and the burdens of power.<br/><br/>Coppola&#39;s masterful direction, combined with rich character development and unforgettable dialogue, has made &quot;The Godfather&quot; a landmark in cinema history. One of the film&#39;s most memorable lines, &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse,&quot; encapsulates the intricate relationships and moral ambiguities that permeate the story.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s atmospheric cinematography and Nino Rota&#39;s haunting score enhance its emotional impact. Each scene is meticulously crafted, drawing the audience into the dark and compelling world of organized crime.<br/><br/>In summary, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is not just a tale of crime; it is a profound exploration of familial bonds, the struggle for power, and the darker aspects of human nature. The film prompts viewers to reflect on moral choices and the consequences of those choices, solidifying its status as one of the greatest films of all time."
15,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally  found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There  is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element  comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema.   I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that  people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of  Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances.   However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find  meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.  Who is your Andy Dufresne?"
37,tt0068646,The Godfather,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.<br/><br/>Yes, it&#39;s a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York&#39;s major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.<br/><br/>Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I&#39;m glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who&#39;s past his prime, but it&#39;s easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film&#39;s most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all."
3088,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This film follows Vito Corleone the leader of a New York Mafia called &#39;family&#39; having to deal with the consequences of ether moving with the times and going into drug related crime or sticking to the traditional old country ways of gambling. This effects his war hero son Michael who has no intentions into going into the family business.<br/><br/>The Godfather is the best gangster/mobster movie ever made in my opinion. Its simply phenomenal. There&#39;s not much I didn&#39;t love in this movie a few things that were a bit dated but made the film even more enjoyable to watch. The acting in this film is fantastic by everyone not just the main gangsters like Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) who brings a chilling confidence in everything he dose now its one of the most iconic performances in cinematic history and it shows, its really good to watch. Same goes for Al Pacino as Michael Corleone he was just gripping to watch to see him slowly change from an good guy war hero to a ruthless mafia leader you completely gets you engrossed. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen was brilliant too, always in the background ready to give helpful advice whenever needed one of my favourites and a really interesting character to watch. Then the less main characters like Talia Shire was amazing in this film she really played her part well. I could go on about each actor in this film but I won&#39;t there&#39;s just some of the standout performances in this film and I can assure you their are more. The directing still to this day is brilliant to watch its simple but very elegant. The script is for me one of the best written in movie history its got some of the most iconic lines every scripted and to have such talented actors its no wonder this film is so popular. The soundtrack again is so memorable at times it brings chills down your spine with thrill and excitement knowing something truly awesome is about to happen. The only thing I thought was a bit dated was just in one scene when Michaels brother Sonny Corleone played very well by James Caan where he is fighting his sisters husband for beating her and you can clearly see he&#39;s miles away from touching him. Like I said tho this just makes this film that bit more fun to watch. Overall this film has some of the best overall acting you are likely to see, some of the most iconic script and music you are likely to hear too. Its a must see for any movie movie watcher, a timeless classic and I hear Part two is even better!"
4932,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Coppola&#39;s master piece, it is one of those &quot;MUST WATCH&quot; again and again!"
1807,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Almost 50 years old this film is still one of the greatest ever. The depth, feeling and acting is top of the charts. For a movie 50 years old, the action scenes and violent parts keep up impressivly well. It is the ultimate film for using the cliché: You dont watch this movie, you experience it."
424,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"My favorite movie ever.  These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie.  A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie, but this is very entertaining.  Tim Robbins (The Player, I.Q.) stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place, but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prison&#39;s head convicts, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Seven).  Soon the warden, played by Bob Gunton (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Broken Arrow), enlists his help as a banker, to help with getting some extra (illegal) money and other things.  It doesn&#39;t sound like a great movie, but trust me this is the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, and everyone I know liked it.  Tim Robbins is great in the lead.  Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden.  William Sadler (Solo, Die Hard 2) is solid as a fellow convict.  Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers, Highlander) is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards.  Finally, James Whitmore (The Relic) and Gil Bellows (Snow White: A tale of terror) give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts.  A must see."
5563,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The reason I do not give The Godfather a 10 out of 10 is because it is not the perfect movie. And the reason why The Godfather is not the perfect movie is because it drags. The movie drags for 3 hours and I have to admit that Marlon Brando as the Godfather is a little overrated. I understand his amazing acting ability but i actually thought De Niro did a better job in Part 2. Pacino as Michael is one of the greatest performances in modern cinema. His performance ranks right up there with De Niro in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, Ray Liotta in Goodfellas, and Tim Robbins in Shawshank Redemption. I love the Godfather although I do understand the criticism the movie receives from people. (too long, boring at times)"
29,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&#39;The Godfather&#39; is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed &#39;The Godfather&#39; I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let&#39;s start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, &#39;I believe in America&#39;, it&#39;s crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film&#39;s &quot;threshold&quot;. This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970&#39;s film industry (including a certain horse&#39;s head), &#39;The Godfather&#39; epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone&#39;s are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood&#39;s greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made."
3227,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Yeah. I don&#39;t think i have to write more than that actually. I think the most of you already know how good this movie is (or how good these movies are), and what the story is. <br/><br/>It has so much emotion and is depicting that world so compelling, it&#39;s hard to explain it without spoilers. <br/><br/>If you like crime movies, watch it. If you like drama, watch it. Do you like suspense and action? Watch it. Do you like music? Watch it. <br/><br/>It&#39;s the kind of movie that has everything. The kind of movie that leaves you breathless, that you will never forget. <br/><br/>The only people who shouldn&#39;t watch it is the ones that only like modern movies with lots of cgi and big explosions and action from start to finish."
4488,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I personally believe that Godfater is one the most boring but &quot;Famous&quot; movies of all time.The moment anybody hears the word GODFATHER they &quot;&quot;want&quot;&quot; to believe that this is the best movie of all but in the real sense it is far from being great.People tell that AL Pacino got known by this movie but all he ever did was keep his mouth shut except for a few scenes unlike his other movies like Scarface,Heat,Devil&#39;s Advocate,Dog Day Afternoon etc.Even the &quot;&quot;great Marlon Brando&quot;&quot; did not have much role in it.The entire movie is filled with conversation and nothing else.If there was A man in this entire planet who never saw or even heard anything about any movie,and you show him &quot;The Godfather&quot;,I bet that he would probably go to sleep within the first 10 minutes.We the people of todays generation are made to believe that this is the best movie of all time by the media and other people.Honestly the only reason i saw this movie was to find out what the hell was there in it that is receiving so much appreciation.Guys who have not seen this movie might also be thinking the same that this movie is the best bit in reality,it is not.This movie is a very long piece of ****"
4107,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Vito had shown his outstanding leadership in the movie. Quite learn a lot from him!Especially the quotes came out from his mouth. The bad-temper Sonny, weak Fredo and calm Michael have shown us the characters of human being. The godfather is not a easy job. He is a leader and must always take care to each other. He need to be fair and discipline.The traitors must be executed even though you are the family members.Really hard to be a godfather. By the way, I vote this movie 10 for the Marlon Brando!Thanks."
2044,tt0068646,The Godfather,&quot;The Godfather&quot; is told entirely within a closed world. That&#39;s why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil
3451,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The movie &quot;The Godfather&quot; is an awesome movie! Some things that inspired me to watch the whole series was: tension, characters, and the love. All of these thing brought the movie to life. It was the most dramatic thing ever; however it was sad. <br/><br/>When Michael says &quot;Ah, that little farce you played with my sister. You think that would fool a Corleone?&quot; The director did the lines terrifically well. This line capturing to me. This would be the most exciting movie that I&#39;ve ever seen! I&#39;m so glad my family recommended it to me. At first I thought that the movie would be horrible, but then I realized that the tension was to much that I had to keep watching it. It was the kind of movie that when it ended you wanted to see the next one just to know what would happen. A few times I cried, but don&#39;t all movies have a crying point in them. It was just to much action, tension, and feeling in the movie for me to stop watching. <br/><br/>The character Al Pancio was my favorite because he has so much energy in his role plays. Some other movies that he played in was: &quot;ScarFace&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot;, and of course &quot;The Godfather&quot;. All of these were his best yet. Al Pancio is the most vibrant actor that I have ever seen, that would probably be why I love his acting so much. Furthermore, another actor would be Richard S. Castellano. Additionally, this man was the one who taught Al Pancio how to shoot the crooked cop in the movie, and the shocking thing was that he used to be a construction manager. One woman, named Talia Shire, also played a role. She has stared not only in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, but in &quot;Rocky&quot;. She is also the stepmother of the Schwartzman family. All these actors/actress were magnificent during the movie, they played their part so well. <br/><br/>The sad thing about the movie would be the death. Moreover, the death was gruesome. It had so much detail that you can&#39;t seem to watch; however, you sometimes just can&#39;t turn away. Although if given a chance it will come to the point that it&#39;s awesome. This stage point of the death will soon rube off in less you hate the fact of blood (lots of blood and cursing). All I&#39;m saying is give it a chance. <br/><br/>The love that the character give to each other is so affectionate, even off scene there still friends. It&#39;s like as though there one big family meeting for a family reunion. Even in the movie they gradually connect. For example, Al Panico and Richard S. Castellano. They were like father and son when they were together, and in the movie they were still like family except at the same time enemies. The movie, when seen, will have the same effect on you once you notice how well they act together. The film went on for $80,000 because Paramount bought in before the book became a best-seller. A previous gangster film bombed at the box office, the company was reluctant to even make the movie, and initially budgeted only $2 million to $3 million. That&#39;s a fact. <br/><br/>Over all, the movie is great to watch. Its tension will follow you until you&#39;ve seen the whole series. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is one of the most never before seen movies with life in it. With what the movie has you will not no what was just watched. The movie is epic and will always be remembered as the most amazing movie ever."
707,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I rarely post comments on movies unless I, {A) Really love it, (B) Really hate it. This falls in the &#39;really love&#39; category. The first time I watched this picture, I thought it was great, but much to dark and emotional, and contained unnecessary violence/sexuality. After viewing it 2 or 3 times, I finally understand why this movie is so highly ranked by IMDb regulars, and I also have come to understand why the scenes of violence and brutality toward Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) were included in this film. I also understand why James Whitmore&#39;s character Brooks Hatlen behaved the way he did. It was all the nastiness that happened to people we really like that makes the victory complete at the end. 5 years ago I would have called The Shawshank Redemption an overrated, self-indulging unnecessarily dark picture deserving a rating of 5 or perhaps 6 at best. Now that the move is nearly 12 years old, and now that I&#39;ve watched it enough to finally &quot;get it&quot;, I must agree with the masses and score this with a 9+. One of the best movies ever made and certainly the best of the Stephen King adaptations. How could I have been so obtuse?"
4764,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Rest in peace, godfather. It&#39;s just, I have to correct you. Even though you don&#39;t spend much time with your family, you&#39;re still a real man. Because your role has taught countless boys to become men. For this reason alone, I will always respect you."
952,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This movie can not come recommended highly enough, the fact that it is constantly near to, or at the top of the Internet Movie Database&#39;s top 250 poll, is surely testament to this.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of my favourite movies of all time. If you are reading these comments, and have not seen this life changing movie (for both the film&#39;s characters AND the viewer), i truly envy you.<br/><br/>It is one of the few movies that I would wish that I have never seen, purely so I could have the pleasure of seeing it again for the first time and re-living how i felt after the credits rolled. It really is that good."
3523,tt0068646,The Godfather,"To understand this films acclaim you have to understand censorship in America. Wikipedia has a nice section on the &#39;Production Code&#39;. In short nothing remotely like this film was seen for decades. So when it was released it was a revelation for American movie audiences. <br/><br/>In todays light the film doesn&#39;t have the same impact it did back then. The script isn&#39;t written that well, the dialogue is labored and dull. Though Brando is amazing and deserved all the accolades he got from the film. <br/><br/>The plot is labored as well and drags in many parts. The enemies of the Corleone family aren&#39;t 3-d enough to really be too invested in the power struggles. In fact things don&#39;t really seem to be alive as in other mobster films like Goodfellas. The illusion of reality here isn&#39;t complete. <br/><br/>Godfather II is by far the tauter and better film, and the best in the series."
4996,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I did love al pacino.<br/><br/>Also James caan
and best of all was Marlon Brando acting !<br/><br/>I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.<br/><br/>Id love to see more these kind movies or even tv series ! Im sure ppl would be mind blowing these kinda tv series existance some near furure the whole trilogy was amazing , especially part 2 and part 3."
1704,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I&#39;m not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I&#39;ve heard so much about this so-called &quot;legendary&quot; Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I&#39;ve ever seen. The characters are all ridiculous, unsympathetic and under developed, the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamics <br/><br/>But the most disgusting aspect is the movie&#39;s intent to glorify a bunch of low-life criminals and turn them into larger-than-life figures, into some kind of royalty. This whole &quot;family&quot; tradition is just ludicrous. We&#39;re supposed to &quot;care&quot; about these characters, to think that they are &quot;cool&quot;. The major problem here is that there&#39;s no real conflict. There&#39;s no redeeming value whatsoever, they&#39;re all despicable and one-dimensional, so why the hell would I care. <br/><br/>The violence (which is particularly sickening) is another issue, but I guess audiences have come to appreciate it, and it&#39;s now a &quot;hallmark&quot; of the genre. Imagine, the Godfather&#39;s pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt. But guess what: she&#39;s not likable either! She&#39;s hysterical, obnoxious and, even worse, she keeps defending her abusive husband. In another scene, James Caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children. Marvelous! That&#39;s just great, not to mention cool and &quot;culturally relevant&quot;. <br/><br/>Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn&#39;t want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development. It&#39;s Pacino&#39;s worst, I can&#39;t imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance. If you want to see a good gangster movie, go watch &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; instead."
1677,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&#39;The Godfather (1972)&#39; doesn&#39;t need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I&#39;m going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two &#39;Godfather&#39; films (1972 - 1974), &#39;The Conversation (1974)&#39; and, perhaps his magnum opus, &#39;Apocalypse Now (1979).&#39; This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of &#39;The Godfather,&#39; and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola&#39;s achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as &#39;The Big Sleep (1946)&#39; always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters&#39; motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.<br/><br/>A notable artistic observation regarding &#39;The Godfather&#39; is that Coppola&#39;s film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis&#39; cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being &#39;Manhattan (1979)&#39;}. A sprawling family saga, &#39;The Godfather&#39; boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film&#39;s running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando  in what, along with &#39;Last Tango in Paris (1972),&#39; was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in &#39;The Godfather: Part II (1974)&#39;}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive &quot;family honour.&quot; The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein&#39;s style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael&#39;s nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family&#39;s enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul."
2375,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself.<br/><br/>The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made but too violent and not enough of the evil of man in it."

1545,tt0068646,The Godfather,"AL Pacino, Marlon Brando, I could go on all day but we would be here for 3 hours, and instead of that you could just see for yourselves how good this movie and actors are. Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 Timeless classic."
4796,tt0068646,The Godfather,"A film better then anything Hollywood has ever produced. The critics adore Citizen Kane (a good film, undoubtably) but it doesn&#39;t have the deep qualities of the Godfather, it is a one man show (which can be good, Taxi Driver, but still...) but in the Godfather the star, Brando, I feel is a supporting character. Excellent as he is in the role, he still doesn&#39;t match the pace and glory of the next generation of Mafia hoods he is tutoring as the role of Don Corleone. The true gem of the bunch is obviously Pacino who controls the screen with a performance that he has never bettered in the 28 years since, but don&#39;t forget the arrogant Sonny (James Caan), the in control Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and my personal favorite, the runt of the litter Fredo, expertly executed by the late John Cazale.<br/><br/>All in all a story of love, power and above all, family."
1572,tt0068646,The Godfather,"What impress me most of Godfather At the wedding, I remembered, after telling the story of his family, Michael said to his girlfriend: &quot;that&#39;s my family, Kay. It&#39;s not me.&quot; However, at the end of movie, he closed the door to let Kay outside."
3623,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Marlon Brando&#39;s old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount&#39;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo&#39;s Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted.<br/><br/>Brando is cool as the godfather, sagacious head of the Corleone &quot;family,&quot; most powerful of the five &quot;families&quot; of organized crime in New York. He is relaxed as the loving, indulgent patriarch of his large blood family, in his mansion behind an iron fence in Long Beach, L.I. And he is terrifically appealing as the man who cheats death, recovers from bullet wounds inflicted by a rival gang, recuperates at home to enjoy his garden and grandchildren until he dies of old age. Once he comes out of seclusion, to warn chiefs of the five &quot;families&quot; that the gang war must stop.<br/><br/>Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to &quot;The Godfather.&quot; But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.<br/><br/>The immensity of the project must have been staggering, but producer Albert S. Ruddy, director Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo, with Coppola, make it seem easy."
3887,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic, all &quot;gangster movies&quot; have been judged by the standards of this one.<br/><br/>If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather&#39;s success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola&#39;s film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.<br/><br/>The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.<br/><br/>The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito&#39;s youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their &quot;adopted&quot; brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don&#39;s right-hand man.<br/><br/>With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.<br/><br/>Don Vito&#39;s refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.<br/><br/>The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it&#39;s therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from &quot;innocent&quot; bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.<br/><br/>Despite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable.<br/><br/>Next to Humphrey Bogart&#39;s Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando&#39;s Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot; has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.<br/><br/>Family responsibility. A father&#39;s legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.<br/><br/>Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York&#39;s Italian crime families. The word &quot;Mafia&quot; conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.<br/><br/>We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn&#39;t take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay&#39;s shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota&#39;s mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens."
4582,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I have seen movies from all genres, but NOTHING and no other movie has surprised me more than The Godfather! This movie has EVERYTHING, a great script, unforgettable performances and characters, great acting and a MIND-BLOWING story line! I was really surprised on how serious this movie was made and the effort it took to make this into a successful masterpiece! Marlon Brando&#39;s performance in this movie is EXCELLENT! I was really enjoying every minute of his screen time and because of his Italian accent and also because he was a very interesting and likable character. The amount of drama that occurs in the film between the five families is absolutely heartbreaking and mind-blowing due to FANTASTIC performances brought to the film! I also really enjoyed Al Pacino&#39;s character known as Michael Corleone! I felt that he had a lot of charisma in almost every scene he was in and he tries to avoid being an idiot character and ends up being another likable character throughout the film! I think this is DEFINITELY a film that everybody should see at least once because it is definitely worth a watch for anyone who LOVES watching movies from any genre including myself. The Godfather is a film that HIGHLY surprised me and it&#39;s a classic and a masterpiece in movie history and it will stay as one of the GREATEST movie of all time and it has to be the greatest movie I have ever seen and i&#39;m gonna give The Godfather a 10/10."
2879,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored.  At the same time I was seeing things like &quot;Scarecrow&quot; and &quot;Deliverance&quot; so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense. <br/><br/>
I&#39;ve seen it again recently, twice.  I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good.  But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I&#39;ve rated it lower than I normally would cause you&#39;ve all gone overboard in your admiration.  <br/><br/>Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice.  He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn&#39;t even have to talk.  James Caan is miscast.  Brando is terrific but if he didn&#39;t win, I don&#39;t think the earth would have ceased existing.  Its Pacino&#39;s movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too."
70,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it&#39;s almost scary.<br/><br/>Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy&#39;s relationship with &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy&#39;s who suffers under the iron will of Norton.<br/><br/>If you haven&#39;t seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the &#39;90&#39;s, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"
2108,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It took me a while to fully appreciate it but The Godfather is a perfect movie. The story is epic, the acting is incredible, the cinematography, locations, costumes and soundtrack are all stunning. It definitely deserves to be as highly rated as it is. The movie also hasn&#39;t dated one bit, it&#39;s a timeless masterpiece. I recently watched the tv show The Offer (which is also great) about the making of the movie. That helped me to appreciate all of the finer details. This film really is legendary. This is one of those time where the stars aligned to allow something truly magical to be created. Unfortunately I doubt that a movie this good will ever be made again. It&#39;s a perfect movie."

And &quot; don&#39;t never forget,hope is good something and good somethings never die &quot; this sentence which passes in the film, I always believe it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so, If it is seized from people,that people lose their aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film, It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption, Whenever I watch this film, I learn that it puts in new things my life.

Al Pacino really stood out among the cast members. The way he portrays a man&#39;s slip into madness is pure gold. The soundtrack is iconic, catchy, and it fits the movie perfectly. This piece of cinema is only second to The Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa in my book. Not only that, but the writing is perfect! The dialogue is unlike almost anything seen before at the time. You feel as it you get to know the characters of this film in real life! This gets an obvious 10/10 and recommendation from me. You MUST watch this movie!

Never have I watched a 3 hour movie that had me gripped from start to finish. It&#39;s a movie about family, greed, religion, honor where you really feel for the characters. The story is fantastic, the acting superb(especially Marlon Brando), the music, the set pieces... everything comes together in this masterpiece.

It does what nearly no movie does. It climbs through your skin, into your soul.

I think this is just another one of those cases where everyone&#39;s convinced themselves it&#39;s so great only because the pretentious critics told us it is, and you&#39;re so afraid of being considered a philistine that you go along with it, telling yourself, yeah, this really is a masterpiece, even though you were bored by it too.<br/><br/>The movie&#39;s pretty boring. None of the characters are likeable. All the big moments of the movie build up to nothing more than &quot;Let&#39;s shoot him&quot; and then they do. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all that keeps happening throughout the movie, in between long drawn out dialogue scenes. And the story&#39;s not even told very well - so many long conversations that don&#39;t really convey anything of any significance; so much pointless stuff happens that doesn&#39;t really add to anything to the plot.<br/><br/>The movie dumps like 20 characters onto us all at once at the wedding scene at the beginning of the movie and then expects us to keep up with which Italian guy is which for the rest of the 3 hours. I constantly had to pause it to search on the Internet for their names to figure out who they&#39;re talking about, which ones are Al Pacino&#39;s brothers, which of them are family, which are his in-laws, who is not related to the family, who works for the old man, who works for the rival families, etc.<br/><br/>I&#39;ll give this film 1/10, not because it&#39;s quite that bad, but because it&#39;s been severely overrated and deserves to drop down a few stars.<br/><br/>The one good thing here is the music is good, I&#39;ll give it that."
711,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250 list. I don&#39;t particularly agree with that, but it is a truly great movie nonetheless. It is moving and compelling, and it touches the heart and soul.<br/><br/>The story is set in the 1940s, and it involves Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins), a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison. As one would expect, he is very unhappy at first, but then he leans that there&#39;s something deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. As the story unfolds, over the years, Andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates, especially &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman), with whom he develops a special friendship.<br/><br/>The story isn&#39;t original or creative, and it&#39;s relatively simple, and a bit predictable, but it&#39;s compelling, moving, and memorable, and there&#39;s a bit more to it which I won&#39;t go into. The movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps, experiences, and emotions of the characters. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances. They really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion. One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned, even for life, but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned. The movie conveys this moral message very strongly, and it truly touches the heart and soul.<br/><br/>I am very glad I watched this movie. It is a truly emotional experience."

121,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Deliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of life in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to really be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn&#39;t take up much of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the difficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods of incarceration. <br/><br/>The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on his usual outstanding performance as &quot;Red&quot; - the wise old con through whose eyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to the nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with Bob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy&#39;s financial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks, imprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole and who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in the only home he ever knew - prison. It&#39;s an interesting twist - experience also by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a prison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an institution.<br/><br/>While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though, there are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are some spoilers ahead.)<br/><br/>I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of Maine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn&#39;t seem to me like something that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a letter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six years, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the improvements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that after a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy&#39;s escape also bothered me. It was too &quot;easy&quot; - even though it took twenty years. And how did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through that dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his escape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story was also clearly telegraphed some time before.<br/><br/>Frankly speaking, I think &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is a bit over-rated here at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is still a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of the survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I give it a 7/10."
2944,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I went into the Godfather expecting a masterpiece from all the reviews and how it number 2 or 3 on the IMDb top 250 films. After watching it I found it very disappointing for a few reasons. <br/><br/>1. You can&#39;t understand what the Godfather is saying half the time for the most part it all sounds like he&#39;s wheezing. If your going to watch this film put on subtitles.<br/><br/>2. Its way to long. the movie is just shy of 3 hours long! Thats long enough and especially most of the time nothing is going on. I found myself not paying attention to most of the boring parts in the film and there&#39;s a lot. <br/><br/>Now I know what your saying, your saying that i don&#39;t like long films. To you I say false i don&#39;t mind long films like the LOTR Return of the king is 4 hours + in the extended edition but there&#39;s a difference LOTR is entertaining there&#39;s action going on throughout 80% of the film. <br/><br/>Now I&#39;m not saying I hated the movie I&#39;m justing saying it has a few flaws and its not perfect by any means. Now I have yet to see Part 2 maybe that will change my mind but right now it doesn&#39;t appeal to me because its 4 hours + long! All I can saying is that it better be more stuff going on in the movie then the first one.<br/><br/>8.7/10 not a bad film but a few flaws"
2078,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Throughout history, well-intentioned men have committed many horrible crimes in the name of their mother countries.  THE GODFATHER is about a well-intentioned man named Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who learns to commit horrible crimes in the name of his family.<br/><br/>The Godfather is Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who heads one of the most powerful crime families in New York.  He has three sons: hot-tempered Santino (James Caan), weak-willed Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael. &quot;Michael,&quot; significantly, is the only Anglicized name of the three.  Michael is the only son who fought for the Americans in World War II, and the only one who wants nothing to do with the family crime business.  He is something of an outsider to his family.<br/><br/>But Michael is devoted to his father.  And when Vito is severely wounded in an attempted assassination by drug dealer Virgil &quot;the Turk&quot; Sollozzo, who thinks Vito&#39;s heir apparent Santino will be readier to deal with him, then Michael saves his life.  Later, Michael murders the Turk and his hired police bodyguard, knowing that he will have to flee to Sicily for breaking the unwritten truce between the police and the Mafia.<br/><br/>The saga of Michael&#39;s rise to head the Corleone family is one of the most fascinating stories ever told on screen.  It is hard to tell a good story about evil, but Coppola succeeds, principally because he shows the sincere devotion to family that lies behind the characters&#39; deeds.  Michael is slowly corrupted into a cold-hearted killer, not by laziness or indifference or any other vice, but by his defining virtue: his love for his father and brothers!  Likewise, Santino comes to grief as a direct result of his only redeeming feature, his devotion to his sister.  This tragic irony suffuses the film.  The viewer thus can forgive the characters somewhat for their crimes, because the life they have been born into gives them a choice between violent crime and abandoning their loved ones.<br/><br/>Nino Rota&#39;s sad, haunting score is superb, and his Siciliana theme is beautiful and tender.  The supporting performances are superb, particularly Abe Vigoda and Richard Castellano as the Godfather&#39;s tough but genial caporegimes, Robert Duvall as the &quot;consigliere&quot; or Mafia lawyer, and Al Lettieri as Sollozzo.  Luca Brasi unfortunately disappears too quickly; his role was more fleshed out in Puzo&#39;s original novel.<br/><br/>Enter a world where murder is &quot;not personal.  It&#39;s strictly business.&quot;  You will never forget it.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of ****."

4981,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It&#39;s difficult watching old films retrospectively and understand why they are so acclaimed. But, The Godfather lives up to the hype. The dialogues are outstanding. The story is captivating. And the performances are extraordinary. Michael Corleone&#39;s transformation is quite riveting. Al Pacino was wonderful. Marlon Brando is also amazing as Don Corleone. The film was slow in some aspects but overall it was an incredible film."

Does it REALLY stand comparison with the Godfather or Seven Samurai? I think not. It&#39;s a manipulative, sentimental Sunday afternoon movie, raised above B-standard by some quality turns by talented actors. Nothing more. And who cares whether Andy could put the poster back in place or not. It&#39;s a patently ridiculous &#39;escape&#39; to begin with. I understand that most of the people on this site will have a pop at me for being a snob, but the fact is I love Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and other &#39;blockbuster&#39; movies. But if you&#39;re looking for a genuinely affecting drama, this doesn&#39;t cut the mustard. Sorry, guys, but you&#39;re all wrong."
5279,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The never ending debate of the best film of all time, the godfather or citizen Kane, doesn&#39;t have a clear answer
Personally I love citizen Kane and I respect it more than nearly any other movie (especially considering the time it came out) but that still doesn&#39;t mean it trumps Francis-Ford Coppala&#39;s masterpiece.
At its core this film is about every pro and con of the mafia. It treats it as necessary evil, but also shows that even the good people in society can easily be corrupted by its power (this is more relevant in the film&#39;s fantastic sequel).
If you haven&#39;t seen this film yet then watch it. You&#39;ll either love it or think it&#39;s overrated but you still won&#39;t regret the experience"
1551,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I was fortunate to see &quot;The Godfather&quot; back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many &quot;gangster&quot; movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about &quot;family&quot; and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino &#39;Sonny&#39; Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have &quot;The Godfather&quot; as number one of all time. To me that doesn&#39;t matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a &quot;gang family&quot; movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.<br/><br/>Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me &quot;One From The Heart&quot;, shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;, another &quot;family&quot; theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story. It is a classic in every respect, and a copy belongs in the library of every serious movie fan.<br/><br/>Plus I will resist the urge to mention that there is a topless scene at exactly 1:52 into the BluRay version of Italian actress Simonetta Stefanelli who was only 17 when this was filmed in 1971.<br/><br/>NOV 2025: I re-watched this movie on the 50th anniversary BluRay edition in 2022 from my public library. No extras but the picture and sound are great. Most of it was fresh, the only scene I really remembered was the horse head in bed with the movie producer."
4535,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I just watched The Godfather and I&#39;m absolutely blown away. It&#39;s a classic that I think everyone should watch at least once in their life. The story follows the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia family, and the struggles of its patriarch, Don Vito Corleone.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando gives an incredible performance as Don Vito Corleone. His portrayal is powerful, charismatic, and captivating. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Diane Keaton all deliver outstanding performances. The direction is masterful, with Francis Ford Coppola bringing the story to life.<br/><br/>The Godfather is an iconic movie that is a must-watch for any movie fan. The story is captivating, the characters are compelling, and the performances are all excellent. It&#39;s a timeless classic that will remain a favorite of movie fans for years to come. Highly recommended."

It has absolutely everything, great directing, acting, storytelling and atmosphere.<br/><br/>This is not just a story about crime but also a story about family, about good and evil and about how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The film that left a deep mark in film art and I would dare say, in art in general.<br/><br/>The cast is exceptional, and Marlon Brando&#39;s acting performance is particularly impressive.<br/><br/>The characters are fascinating, layered, and the cast really embodied them perfectly. The subtle details with which the director slowly builds the story and atmosphere are excellent.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography are brilliant, everything in the film makes sense and has its place, a truly fascinating film work.

I don&#39;t care what anyone&#39;s take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal, this movie is moving. There are three movies, in my opinion, that every man, or developing man, should watch: Shawshank Redemption, Dancing With Wolves, and Brave Heart. Unless you are a total pansy, these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. Andy Dufrane is the person in us. Red is the person we want to be.

2691,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn&#39;t depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. <br/><br/>The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won&#39;t be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.<br/><br/>The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
4040,tt0068646,The Godfather,"From the wedding scene, the &quot;I Believe in America&quot; speech, and the horses&#39; head in the bed, there has not been a better film.  While you may think this designation is undeserved, you would be wrong.  Few movies have slipped into society like this one has. The opening wedding scene ranks as one of the most effective introductions in film history.  We get to know all the characters, from Don Vito Coreleone (Marlon Brando, in a masterful performance) to his sons, Michael (Al Pacion), Sonny (James Caan), and Fredo (John Cazale). <br/><br/>
  Several scenes from this movie will remain in your mind for quite a while. Marlon Brando&#39;s wheezing death, The baptism sequence cut in with several murders.  The beginning wedding sequence, and the ending.  The dialogue is perfect, thanks to an incredible script by Mario Puzo and Coppola<br/><br/>Everything about this film is on target.  Nino Rota&#39;s beautiful score is one of the best, with the &quot;Love Theme&quot; ranking as one of the most famous pieces of film music ever.  The performances are all first rate.  Though Marlon Brando won the award, it is really Al Pacino who is the lead actor, and deserved the best actor Oscar.  James Caan also finds the right note as the aggressive, impulsive Sonny.  The cinematography and art direction are perfect.  And all this comes down to Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s masterful direction.  There is no way Bob Fosse deserved the Oscar over Coppola.<br/><br/>
  Is this film better than Citizen Kane?  Tough to say. Both were ground-breaking classics that utilized new technical and narrative techniques.  I would have to say yes, because the story here, about loyalty, family and honor, had more impact on me than the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane."
2947,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Imagine a room full of seasoned movie goers and critics. The topic of discussion - what movies are the best ever? And the name that unanimously pops up as a strong contender for the top spot - The Godfather. With an incredible star cast, an incredible director (Francis Ford Coppola) and a strong story (Mario Puzo) this movie surely deserves all the praise that it can get.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a three hour movie based on the life of the Italian American Mafioso based on the original novel written by Mario Puzo, who also has written the screenplay along with Coppola for the movie as well. It stars legendary and highly respected actors namely Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, etc.<br/><br/>What makes Al Pacino&#39;s role particularly tough is the evolution and the development of his character. He starts out as a person who does not want to do anything with the family business and as circumstances change he gradually changes the direction of his life and evolves throughout the movie. And Pacino does it splendidly. Surely his acting skills are not overrated as some might feel.<br/><br/>The story is a depiction of bitter reality, a bitter reality that was already put forward in the novel and made more accessible and imaginable in the movie. Perhaps this also explains why some haters of the movie exist. It does not offer the escape from reality many other movies seem to offer and let us face it - it is not a simple, straight story to understand. Though 3 hours in length, many viewers could watch it over and over again and each time a viewer watches it he might understand it in greater depth.<br/><br/>The direction is near flawless. This is one huge reason why this movie is always critically on the top spot. Incredible research has been done by Copolla and Puzo in depicting the Mafia world. How does a Don think? How does he protect himself by organizing layers and layers within his empire that render him untouchable by the law? How insecure does he feel? What does he consider when he plans a move? How careful does he have to be in every step that he takes? How does he exploit the whole system around him in order to be the one controlling all the strings (please note the puppeteer&#39;s strings in the logo of the movie The Godfather)? These are some of the questions both the movie and the novel try and answer.<br/><br/>For those of you who have read the novel, I am pretty sure most of you will not be disappointed. It is the best example of how best can a movie be made out of a splendid novel! And for those who saw this movie and liked it, I&#39;d suggest that you read the novel as well for it shall explain in even greater depth the subtle details of the working machinery of the Mafia empire. And yes, please see The Godfather 2 as well.<br/><br/>And may I also add in the end that the second part &quot;Godfather 2&quot; is a fulfillment of the first. A must watch for every person who has watched part one.<br/><br/>I am sure that this movie is going to retain the honour of its top spot and critical finesse for many years to come."
4344,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Old but Gold. <br/><br/>It&#39;s been more than 3 decades after it was released but its influenced still haunting lot of movies and TV series (the recent example is The Sopranos). <br/><br/>I don&#39;t want to write the plot in here, I believe moviegoers already familiar about the story line. It was always not about firing a gun but it was always about how a civilian turned into most powerful gangster ever; it was always about people around you might against you at the other days; it was always about the real family around your another family; it was always about the love around family; it was always about how you sacrifice your life for your family.<br/><br/>It might be boring for you who might expecting a gun firing scene and car chasing in the middle of traffic jam; however this movie was not about that. <br/><br/>The story line : 10/10 The greatest concept behind the screenplay is how a civilian turned into a gangster to protect its family. <br/><br/>The acting : 10/10 All actors played perfectly.

2930,tt0068646,The Godfather,"`I believe in America&#39; are the first words spoken in The Godfather. The fact that they resonate with such power to someone who has no personal or professional ties with the country speaks volumes. <br/><br/>My first viewing of this film was anticipated with equal amounts excitement and trepidation. How could a film of such enormous stature possibly live up to anyone&#39;s expectations, let alone mine? Over two and a half hours later I realised I would probably never see a finer film in my life. And about six or seven years on from that revelatory experience, that view grows ever stronger. With the exception of The Godfather Part Two that is. But that&#39;s a film for another day. <br/><br/>The Godfather is now so much a part of our culture that it becomes difficult to talk about it as a film by itself. Entire books have been written on how it has not only affected change in the way films are conceived by individuals and whole studios, but also the very nature of the film industry itself. At the time nobody could have predicted that a lengthy (and costly) film set in the 1940&#39;s with a relatively little know cast and a serious and weighty subject matter could have made such a huge profit at the box office. Much like in the film itself, ambition and bravado is rewarded with great success and power, and this was true for many of the cast and crew with their subsequent careers. <br/><br/>There may be spoilers ahead but the plot and events in this film are now so well documented I doubt anyone will be surprised.<br/><br/>The film opens with a wedding taking place between Don Vito Corleone&#39;s daughter, Connie and Carlo, a wannabe member of the Family. While the celebrations take place outside in glorious sunshine, in the darkened rooms of the main house Don Vito pays court to various people requesting help with whatever problems they need assistance with. This is where Bonasera, a local baker, opens the film with the aforementioned line and seeks revenge on two men who savagely beat his daughter after she refused their advances. The subsequent conversation sets the tone for the rest of the film. Respect is always demanded from those in power and who are willing to use that power to benefit you. But there may always be a favour required by The Don in return. Later in the film, this favour is repaid to The Don in a way that is both shocking and relieving to Bonasera. Every element in this first scene demands attention from the audience and rewards them by setting a very high standard thereon. The way the camera slowly pulls back from Bonasera to reveal The Don listening to the story as we are, the use of lighting to almost hide The Don&#39;s eyes in the darkness, and the expressions, the voice and even the movement of Marlon Brando as The Don immediately put us in the company of one of THE great acting performances. Also attendant at the wedding are The Don&#39;s sons, Sonny the firey tempered James Cann, the weak willed Fredo played by John Cazale and Michael, the youngest and most cool headed of the brothers, played as such by Al Pacino. As with Brando, you are assured career defining performances by all three men, and I don&#39;t think any of them reached these acting heights again. Equally impressive but not strictly a family member is Robert Duvall as The Don&#39;s Consilgerie, Tom Hagen. <br/><br/>In a nutshell (if such a thing were possible) the film follows the reluctant but necessary rise of Michael to the head of The Family and his dealings with his immediate family, his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), the ranked members that protect their Family (Tessio, Clemenza, etc), other Mafia Families and corrupt  state officials. Throughout the film Michael&#39;s views on his involvement with his Family change from the events that happen to his father after The Don refuses to involve his Families resources in distributing drugs into the city. When The Don is gunned down and left for dead in the street, and Michael has his jaw broken by corrupt Police Captain McCluskey, whilst trying to protect his unguarded father in the hospital, he sets in motion the revenge killing of both McCluskey and Sollozzo, the man partly responsible for the attempt on Don Vito. The result of the ensuing incredible set piece makes it necessary for Michael to leave the country to Sicily until it is safe to return. There he experiences both happiness and tragedy, as he takes a new bride, Apollonia, and receives news that Sonny was killed for a hit he had ordered on a rival Families son in previous retribution for the hit on The Don. Sonny&#39;s death scene is itself one of the most memorable set pieces in all of cinema. When a failed attempt on Michael leaves Apollonia dead, he returns to America, cold and hardened by these terrible events. There he begins to pick up where he left his life with Kay and moves to become his fathers heir. <br/><br/>The phrase that there is honour among thieves is nowhere more relevant than in The Godfather. Michael, Sonny, Fredo and Tom are bound together by the respect and loyalty they hold for their father (in Tom&#39;s case, unofficially adopted) and the Corleone name. Their Family will always come before anything else, as shown when Michael leaves for Sicily without much of a thought towards Kay (being both Jewish and a woman excludes her from the Family), or when Sonny rushes to his sister Connie&#39;s aid (and ultimately his demise) after she receives another vicious beating by Carlo.<br/><br/>
Some of the most fondly remembered and famous scenes in cinema occur throughout The Godfather. The sequence with Khartum&#39;s severed head is an undisputed classic for both the shock value and for showing us early on how far and what type of methods the Family will employ. Sonny&#39;s murder is brutal and affecting, the attempted hit on The Don is wonderfully staged with the camera looking down on the event from above, the cumulative killings of the heads of the five Families at the end is a masterpiece of editing (note to George Lucas circa Phantom Menace. This is how you direct separate climactic events that reach toward the same goal!) , and these are only some of the major events that take place. There are so many great lines that it would be fruitless to list even some of them here, as many of them are now as much a  part of the English language as any piece of classic text. What I will mention however, are the delivery on some of the lesser known phrases. When Tom has to tell The Don that `They shot Sonny on the causeway. He&#39;s dead&#39;, it&#39;s a heartbreaking moment both for himself, The Don and the audience and we can completely emphasise with their pain. The fact that we can emphasise at all with these criminals and killers is not only due to the acting, writing and directing of these characters, but that the Corleone Family is just that shade more moral and honourable than the other Families depicted in the film. When The Don calls a meeting with the heads of the five Families to clear the bad blood between them and prepare for Michael&#39;s return to America, his delivery of the line `..but I&#39;m a superstitious man..&#39; and subsequent warning is so powerful and commanding that nobody but Brando could have pulled it off with such weight and grandeur. When Michael asks the powerful Vegas hotel owner Moe Green that `You straightened out my brother?&#39; the threat&#39; is so tangible that Moe is immediately sorry and Fredo tries to make light of the situation by assuring Mike that he and Moe are best of friends. Thus begins the tragic downfall of Fredo At the beginning of the film when Michael is telling Kay about his family he assures her that `That&#39;s my family Kay, it&#39;s not me&#39;. At the end of the film he tells her `Don&#39;t ask me about my business Kay&#39;. Both times he is completely sincere and believable. <br/><br/>All throughout the film there are little moments where there may not be any dialogue or anything particularly important that happens to the plot, but they made such an impression on me that I have to mention some of them. The moment when Sonny bites down on his fist so (I assume) he wouldn&#39;t swear in front of Connie when he sees the bruise marks left on her face by Carlo, gave me goosebumps. The shot of the Statue of Liberty in the backdrop after Clemenza takes Paulie out to pick up some Cannelloni and has Rocco kill him and leave him bleeding in the car. The simple shrug of The Don&#39;s eyebrows when Tom returns from meeting Jack Woltz, and the previous shot was hearing Woltz&#39;s continued screams after finding the head of his beloved horse Khartum, in his bed when he awoke. The impeccable way Michael looks, dresses and carries himself when we first see him after returning from America as he steps out of a car toward Kay, and the way Brando&#39;s face literally crumbles as he is told of Sonny&#39;s death. <br/><br/>Every technical element in this film is of the highest level. The cinematography is beautifully composed and framed, the period designs of New York are utterly believable and we never assume we&#39;re in any other time. The music is simply stunning and perfectly highlights the mood of the characters throughout, with the main theme one of the most recognisable pieces of music in cinema. When watching this, the film simply FEELS rich. I take a great sense of importance and history from it, as though it&#39;s not merely a film but something much bigger. And there are plenty of arguments to support this, given the massive impact it has left not only on the film industry, but also on American businesses, commerce and crime. There are many stories of real life Mafiosi who base their lifestyle and way of conducting business on the Corleone way. <br/><br/>I think the best compliment I can pay to The Godfather is that once the door is closed on Kay&#39;s face and we&#39;ve both been shut out, I feel like I&#39;ve witnessed an event, rather than just watch a film."

Wake up people! Quote Bill Hicks &quot;Piece of Sh*t&quot;.<br/><br/>OK I&#39;ll give it that there isn&#39;t anything to complain about the acting or directing, etc. But this entire movie seems to be a compromise. I also think that the success of this film is based on the &quot;least worst principle&quot; and that makes it bad.<br/><br/>I&#39;m also fed up with the narrator and all the dramatic film music.

3854,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&#39;&#39;The Godfather&#39;&#39; is told entirely within a closed world. That&#39;s why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.<br/><br/>During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.<br/><br/>The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t ever take sides against the family.&#39;&#39; It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone&#39;s daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter&#39;s rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.<br/><br/>&#39;&#39;I went to the police, like a good American,&#39;&#39; the man says. The Godfather&#39;s reply will underpin the entire movie: &#39;&#39;Why did you go to the police? Why didn&#39;t you come to me first? What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you&#39;d come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if, by chance, an honest man like yourself should make enemies . . . then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.&#39;&#39; As the day continues, there are two more scenes in the Godfather&#39;s darkened study, intercut with scenes from the wedding outside. By the end of the wedding sequence, most of the main characters will have been introduced, and we will know essential things about their personalities. It is a virtuoso stretch of film-making: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather&#39;s world.<br/><br/>The screenplay of &#39;&#39;The Godfather&#39;&#39; follows no formulas except for the classic structure in which power passes between the generations. The writing is subtly constructed to set up events later in the film. Notice how the request by Johnny Fontane, the failing singer, pays off in the Hollywood scenes; how his tears set up the shocking moment when a mogul wakes up in bed with what is left of his racehorse. Notice how the undertaker is told &#39;&#39;someday, and that day may never come, I will ask a favor of you. . .&#39;&#39; and how when the day comes the favor is not violence (as in a conventional movie) but Don Vito&#39;s desire to spare his wife the sight of their son&#39;s maimed body. And notice how a woman&#39;s &#39;&#39;mistaken&#39;&#39; phone call sets up the trap in which Sonny (James Caan) is murdered: It&#39;s done so neatly that you have to think back through the events to figure it out."
4161,tt0068646,The Godfather,honestly one of the most boring movies I&#39;ve ever seen! i would&#39;ve enjoyed it more if it was shorter. i really don&#39;t get how its one of the most talked about movies of all time. i rated it 5 after watching but i&#39;m giving it a 3 now. and i&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;m never gonna complete the second and third films.
1583,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is a great piece of work no doubt about that. The acting is natural, the direction is good and cinematography even better. When they say that every frame is a painting...they mean it. And the brilliantly exicuted deaths of whoever dies in this movie.
But
The problem is that it didn&#39;t match the hype for me.
It was suggested to Me by my friend and he said that this was the best movie he had ever saw. As he had seen a lot of movies I decided to watch this movie. This movie is boring in some parts and not completely interesting throughout. I finished this movie in 5 sittings. The scenes are unnecessarily dragged for no reason at all.
And I tried hard to really root for the characters which didn&#39;t happen in my case.
The bgm is great.....but to use the same bgm again and again got me irritated.<br/><br/>Overall great movie but highly overrated and boring"
4365,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The classic gangster movie that all others after it aspire to be like. Yes its long, but engaging throughout. A realistic view into the life of being in the mob family from all perspectives, the boss, the wives, the rest of the family, the cops, and the others on the outside. &quot;Never hate your enemies&quot; and &quot;friendship is everything&quot; are my favorites quotes. Inevitably in the mob world back stabbing and double-crossing happens, and outside of the mob world too."
4961,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather stands as a towering achievement in cinema-a film whose brilliance has only deepened with time. Francis Ford Coppola orchestrates every element with masterful precision, crafting a world that feels both mythic and intimate. His direction is not merely skillful; it is visionary, blending operatic grandeur with a meticulous attention to character and detail.<br/><br/>The cast delivers performances that have become the gold standard for acting in film. Marlon Brando&#39;s Oscar-winning turn as Don Vito Corleone remains one of the most iconic portrayals in screen history, a blend of quiet authority, vulnerability, and quiet menace. Al Pacino, in a transformative and haunting performance, charts Michael Corleone&#39;s descent from reluctant outsider to ruthless patriarch with chilling subtlety.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s dialogue is etched into the cultural lexicon, its lines quoted and revered across generations. Yet The Godfather is far more than a collection of memorable moments; it is a profound meditation on family, power, loyalty, and moral decay. It humanizes the Mafia without glorifying it, inviting us into a world where honor and brutality coexist, and where tragedy unfolds not from randomness, but from choices made in the name of love and duty.<br/><br/>Coppola&#39;s adaptation elevates Mario Puzo&#39;s novel into timeless mythology. Every frame is imbued with intention, every character laden with complexity. To call The Godfather a masterpiece almost feels insufficient-it is a cornerstone of American cinema, a film whose artistry, emotional depth, and narrative force remain unmatched. Decades after its release, it is as compelling, as resonant, and as essential as ever."
4778,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather has been showered with praise by nearly all major critics out there. This has been called the greatest movie of all time by many film buffs. I prefer Star Wars a bit more though, but that doesn&#39;t mean I hate this classic. I love this movie and I can see why it has received praise across the globe.<br/><br/>A movie that heavily involves family matters and crime of course. I&#39;m not sure whether to call this an action film though some top critics have dubbed the Godfather as a top rate action movie, but it doesn&#39;t have the over-the-top action of Michael Bay movies. This one has better action because you can soak it in and understand what&#39;s going on, not just watch it and forget it like the action scenes in Transformers 2.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse.&quot; When you hear that line, you&#39;re in the world of cinema. When will they make another movie like this again? Let&#39;s hope it&#39;s soon. The Godfather is that kind of movie that deserves all the attention and respect it gets."
4717,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It&#39;s the 1st out of 3 movies. If you ask me, you must watch all of them.
As a gangster moive, and appart from this genre, it is one of the best movies I have ever watched."
1897,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is best movie ever
This film taught me a lot of things like patience, caution, suspicion, restraint and quietly speaking"
1147,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"What makes The Shawshank Redemption so timeless is its message: no matter how trapped or isolated one feels, hope can never be fully taken away. The film&#39;s ending, which brings Andy&#39;s long-anticipated escape and Red&#39;s eventual freedom, is one of the most uplifting conclusions in cinema history.<br/><br/>The cinematography and production design also contribute significantly to the film&#39;s atmosphere. The prison, with its towering walls and stark interiors, feels like a character in itself-cold and imposing, yet containing small pockets of humanity. The score by Thomas Newman is haunting and elevates the emotional impact of key moments."
2031,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I really love this movie, and it is my favorite out of all three.  They are unable to fully describe in words, they are masterpieces.  This and the other two movies inspired me and moved me emotionally. I was crying at the end of the third movie!  I felt as though I knew the characters personally, and felt anger and grief and sorrow and happiness throughout the rise and near fall of the Corleone Family.  This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made, and you haven&#39;t lived yet if you love movies and haven&#39;t seen these films."
4585,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is a good film. It is well directed and well acted. The story is engaging, and the sets flawlessly reflect the time period. And yet... it is only a *good* movie. I know that I will probably be hated for saying this, but &quot;The Godfather&quot; really doesn&#39;t seem like a masterpiece. Although it is certainly one of the most influential films of its time, I can&#39;t help but feel that it is a little overrated. Perhaps my tastes just aren&#39;t the same as everyone else&#39;s. And then again... maybe I am right, and a film doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;perfect&quot; to be memorable. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is worth watching... once... mainly because it has become such an integral part of our culture. It set the stage for epic crime dramas, and that alone is impressive. But... is it really so much better than other films? The first doesn&#39;t always have to be the best. &quot;The Godfather&quot; lays down a very solid foundation for future cinema, much as &quot;Gone With the WInd&quot; did, way back in the day (don&#39;t even get me started on that one). It is by no means perfect, but it is, like I said, worth watching."
4494,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I&#39;ve never been so bored in my life like when i watched this movie. I started watching it with a big expectations due to what people say about it . But at the end, i ended up forcing my self to finish it. maybe because it&#39;s too old ? i don&#39;t know. The only good thing was the acting for sure. The main actor was a phenomenon."
82,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story. <br/><br/>Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film. <br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.<br/><br/>
This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one."
3570,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Dom: I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse: FAMILY<br/><br/>The trilogy began. It&#39;s a story about family, revenge, and heritage in a mafia family in New York. The first half was a bit slow with many scenes that I felt lingered a bit too long. However, I loved Marlon Brando as The Godfather. The way he looked and acted was cool and conveyed a respected boss. I&#39;m not entirely convinced on Al Pacino&#39;s character&#39;s transition, still in the second half his character became significantly better and more commanding. Of course the ending was awesome and showed the ironic way that Al Pacino&#39;s character changed. Overall it&#39;s a great first third. 8/10."
969,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,The movie depicts how a man can achieve the most incredible feats once sheer will is applied.
5685,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I might have been biased because I think I fell in love with this classic movie before I even watched it but my expectations were absolutely met, may have even exceeded.<br/><br/>The movie begins, black screen but you hear the music, then &quot;I believe in America...&quot;. Perfect. The man tells the Godfather his story. Instantly grabbing my attention.<br/><br/>The characters, dialogue, music, cinematography, everything is just what I consider perfection.<br/><br/>Such a deep and relatable story even if it&#39;s a story about the Italian Mafia.<br/><br/>I only ended up having one issue, just one issue but it&#39;s a small. The scene with the Godfather glitching up when playing with his grandson lol."
1372,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This is such a good movie! Excellent screenplay and directing. And the casting is fantastic; everyone just fit their part like a hand in glove. The whole story flows smoothly that you forget it&#39;s all make-believe.<br/><br/>I told one of my friends many times to watch this film and it took her years before she actually did. Once finished she said, &quot;What took me so long? This movie is soooo good!&quot;."
2405,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Although the 19th Century saw the creation of motion pictures, it wasn&#39;t until the 20th Century that films really took off. During times of hardships, audience flocked to their local cinemas to catch the latest flick, which invigorated Hollywood&#39;s movie studios to create imaginative &amp; lavish films. This subsequently lead to the creation of some of the most innovative &amp; influential films during the 20th Century. Among the list of 20th Century masterpieces is the critically-acclaimed film The Godfather (1972). Based on the novel by Mario Puzo &amp; directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather breaks all norms of the film industry. A phenomenal cast, a powerful soundtrack and an enriching plot propels The Godfather into a high standard of films. By the end of the film, the audience would be persuaded to sympathize with the Corleone family &amp; their &quot;business&quot;. The Godfather should be on everyone&#39;s bucket list for &quot;Movies to Watch Before You Die&quot;. Stop reading this and go watch it if you already haven&#39;t!"
1898,tt0068646,The Godfather,&quot;The Godfather&quot; - it is incredible what resonance this name has.I am from a poor country where cinematography has just started to become part of our lives and i&#39;ve always heard of this movie but never until now got to see it.Before viewing it i checked up on it to see what i should expect from it and i was mesmerized by all the comments and the praise it gets.I said to myself i shouldn&#39;t get my hopes high because I most probably will be disappointed after i see it.So i acquired it and i started viewing...after 20 minutes i had the &quot;one of those movies&quot; feeling.I like to &quot;live&quot; every movie i watch and entering in the Corleone family was the most incredible cinematic experience i have ever had.It is one of those movies that you just can&#39;t get your mind off even after 2 weeks since you&#39;ve seen it...you keep reminding the characters and the sets and everything and you blend in creating scenarios in your head and feel the drama.The music is superb and every time i hear it i get chills up my spine and begin day dreaming.I am afraid to watch it again because maybe i will get the impression it&#39;s not that great but it will happen soon i think and i will relive it though first time you watch it you get the most shocking experience you can get.This is one of the few movies that will always remain in my head and that my soul will hang on to in the desperate wish that I will actually live for real an experience like this ( my intellect knows it will never happen but you just can&#39;t control these strong feelings).

3825,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;The Godfather&quot; is a &#39;terrible&#39; film.<br/><br/>It&#39;s &#39;the worst&#39; movie I&#39;ve seen in a decade. The acting in this film is &#39;excruciatingly painful&#39;. The whole family are &#39;watered down Sopranos&#39; who show some phenomenally strong &#39;lack of&#39; chemistry. The &#39;boring&#39; weeding scene is the &#39;highlight&#39;.<br/><br/>Michael is a &#39;wet fish&#39; and his relationship with Kay is very dumb, and also &#39;stupid&#39; and &#39;weird&#39;. The Godfather scenes make me &#39;sick&#39; and &#39;woozy&#39;. I haven&#39;t seen such dramatized &#39;try to be cool&#39; dialogue since &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;.<br/><br/>Pacino was less wooden in &quot;Gigli&quot;. That other film he also &#39;carried&#39;. Both Puzo and Brest were largely let down thanks to this &#39;Tony Montana&#39; The characters of Sonny and Fredo were so &#39;unrealistic&#39; I thought they were &#39;comic book&#39;. I must also highly criticize the music in this film as being &#39;childish&#39; and sometimes often &#39;out of place&#39;.<br/><br/>Now on to some other failings of this &#39;pathetic&#39; movie. The dialogue was &#39;silly&#39;. If it was supposed to be nail-biting, well, it &#39;failed&#39;. The manner in which the actors delivered their lines was &#39;uninspiring&#39;. Brando in particular &#39;sucked&#39;. What about the &#39;long&#39; and &#39;tired&#39; Sicily scenes? Reference to four hours of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; I don&#39;t know? The car exploding was so &#39;unoriginal&#39; and &#39;clichéd&#39;. And the &#39;take over&#39; cross baptism montage. Come on, do some CGI instead! Bah, &#39;armatures&#39;.<br/><br/>How this is ranked above that masterpiece &quot;Muriel&#39;s Wedding&quot; stumps me. If they had replaced the old and tired Francis Ford with the more youthful Nicolas they might have hit pay dirt."

5019,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is indeed a timeless classic, as many critics and audiences have agreed. It is a film that explores the themes of family, loyalty, power, corruption, and violence in a captivating and realistic way. It features some of the most memorable performances, scenes, and dialogues in cinema history, as well as a masterful direction by Francis Ford Coppola and a haunting score by Nino Rota. The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the best films ever made, and has influenced countless filmmakers and genres.<br/><br/>Some of the aspects that make The Godfather a timeless classic are:<br/><br/><ul><li>The complex and compelling characters: The film portrays the Corleone family as a complex and dynamic group of individuals, each with their own motivations, flaws, and conflicts. The film shows how they interact with each other, with their allies and enemies, and with the changing world around them. The film also explores the psychological and moral transformations of some of the characters, especially Michael Corleone, who goes from being an innocent war hero to a ruthless crime boss.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The realistic and immersive setting: The film depicts the world of the American Mafia in the 1940s and 1950s, with great attention to detail and authenticity. The film recreates the historical and cultural context of the time, showing the political and social issues that affect the characters and their actions. The film also uses various locations, such as New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Sicily, to create a rich and diverse visual landscape.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The powerful and memorable scenes: The film contains many scenes that have become iconic and unforgettable in film history, such as the opening wedding scene, the horse head scene, the restaurant scene, the baptism scene, and the final montage. These scenes are masterfully crafted by Coppola, using cinematography, editing, music, sound, and acting to create tension, emotion, suspense, and impact.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The quotable and meaningful dialogues: The film is full of dialogues that have become part of popular culture and language, such as &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot;, &quot;Leave the gun. Take the cannoli&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s not personal. It&#39;s strictly business&quot;, &quot;Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer&quot;, and &quot;I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart&quot;. These dialogues are not only catchy and memorable, but also reveal the characters&#39; personalities, values, and philosophies.</li></ul><br/><br/>These are some of my thoughts and insights on why The Godfather is a timeless classic. What do you think? Do you have a favorite character or scene from the film? 😊"
2612,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo&#39;s best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.<br/><br/>The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.<br/><br/>The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis&#39; dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones."
3471,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself.<br/><br/>The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made but too violent and not enough of the evil of man in it."
90,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"An overrated film that I watched as a teenager and recently decided to re-watch. I must say right away that I like this film, but it is undeservedly and too popular and occupies the first line - this is completely undeserved in comparison with other films of more talented authors.
I am very saddened that people do not see other works, and for so long this film has been number one among the best films. The actors are talented, the plot is just good, not brilliant, like Stanley Kubrick in &quot;A Space Odyssey&quot;. Even this I am ready to see in the top-1, but not &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot;. I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate, but this is not true, and you can understand this by comparing it with other films, is this film so good and does it deserve the first place?"
5328,tt0068646,The Godfather,This is been excellent and favorite movie all the time. Mr. Francis done really a great in the history of cinematography. First opening scene has revealed the outstanding performance of Mr. Marlon Brando. Al Pacino was absolutely amazing in his young age. This movie set the dimension of a underworld trend setter movie.
4869,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I finally got around to seeing this movie.  I highly recommend it for reasons I&#39;m sure the many other reviewers have already voiced.  In particular, Marlon Brando gives one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it didn&#39;t quite live up to the billing as best picture of all time and was not flawless as many claim it to be...  I had two major problems with the Godfather.  First, even thought the movie is three hours long I felt that the character of Michael was still underdeveloped. Michael&#39;s &quot;transformation&quot; is the focal point of the movie, yet we see almost nothing of him in the first third of the movie and we can&#39;t really tell how much of an internal change he makes.  Leaving a little mystery and leaving things up to interpretation is fine but I thought this was a bit extreme.<br/><br/>Second, the female characters were one-dimensional, naive and passive to the point of incredulity.  Take for example the scene between Michael and Kay after Michael returns from his absence -- oh come on!<br/><br/>Despite these qualms, it was still very enjoyable and something that everyone should probably watch at least once.  My rating: 8.5 out of 10"
4777,tt0068646,The Godfather,"*The Godfather* (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is widely acclaimed as one of cinema&#39;s greatest masterpieces. Its meticulous storytelling and rich character development elevate it beyond a typical crime drama. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino deliver iconic performances that explore themes of power, loyalty, and family within the context of organized crime. The film&#39;s atmospheric cinematography, coupled with a memorable score by Nino Rota, enhances its immersive experience. The intricate portrayal of moral ambiguity and familial obligations makes it a compelling study of character and consequence, solidifying its place as a landmark in film history."

2460,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In short, &quot;Godfather&quot; is a cinematic masterpiece that examines the complex world of organized crimes and the destructive influence of power. The themes of the family, loyalty and American dream are still resonated with the audience, and its characters and dialogues have become symbolic. Its impact on popular culture and the film industry is undeniable and is still one of the best films made. In addition to critical and commercial success, &quot;Godfather&quot; has had a significant cultural impact. This film with its characters, quotes, and scenes that are often inThe popular media is referred to and imitated, it has become a cultural benchmark. The influence of the film can also be seen in many films and television programs, after which they examined similar themes of organized crimes and the acquisition of power. The success of the &quot;Godfather&quot; also had two sequels, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and &quot;The Party of Part III&quot;. Although not as admirable as the original film, the sequels are still very popular and examined by the themes and characters introduced. The first film continues. &quot;The Godfather&quot; has also been the subject of many academic analysis and studies. The film&#39;s exploration of the American dream, the experience of immigrants, and the destructive influence of power have made it a popular topic for discussion. In general, &quot;Godfather&quot; is an eternal classic that is still resonating among the audience today. Exploring humanitarian conditions, depicting American dreams and examining the underlying world of criminals has made it a prominent film in American cinema."

1828,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show &quot;Sopranos&quot;. But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.<br/><br/>Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn&#39;t hold back.<br/><br/>The performances are awesome and I can&#39;t wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I&#39;ll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don&#39;t agree with the way the &quot;family&quot; functions (and you shouldn&#39;t agree with it of course, just saying)"
2645,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Some people have called this one of the best movies of all time. I can see why they say that, although I wouldn&#39;t quite rate it that high. It does feature an interesting storyline, great acting and magnificent photography so I am not going to argue with those who place in so high, because it&#39;s understandable. It also has a memorable score.<br/><br/>One needs to see this on a nice widescreen DVD because it&#39;s so beautifully photographed with tons of greens, grays and browns that are just beautiful. It makes me want to visit Italy. The only reason I personally didn&#39;t rate it as high as others was I didn&#39;t like any of the characters, and especially the hot-headed James Caan. When he got riddled with bullets and was done with, a la &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde,&quot; that was fine with me!<br/><br/>There isn&#39;t as much violence as people might think, if they&#39;ve never seen this movie. To some, this film might be too slow, in fact. However, when the violence or something dramatic occurs it is intense and can be very brutal. Who can ever forget a guy waking up with a dead, bloody horse in his bed?!! <br/><br/>Like a good film noir, there is a lot of tension running throughout the Godfather films. Everybody is after somebody it seems and you never know whom to trust. That&#39;s part of the downsides of living a criminal life: constant paranoia. All this is put together nicely as we become close observers of the Corleone family, its family ties and its &quot;business.&quot;<br/><br/>Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Robert DeNiro (later in the saga), Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Richard Castellano, on and on - quite a cast and quite a movie. I enjoyed both sequels, too.<br/><br/>I am also fortunate to own &quot;The Godfather Epic&quot; on tape, which must be some sort of collector&#39;s item by now. It is three two-hour tapes in which Godfather I and II are sliced together and the story is presented in chronological order, instead of with all the flashbacks. It&#39;s well-done and I would have printed a review on that version, but I don&#39;t see it listed on IMDb."

1795,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Coppola&#39;s crime saga is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope, focusing as much on family dynamics as mafia machinations, and is all the more impactful for it. &#39;The Godfather (1972)&#39; honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you&#39;ve witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It&#39;s actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That&#39;s a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10"
2986,tt0068646,The Godfather,"with no doubt,the greatest movie of all time.loyalty,family relations,business,power,authority or enmity are all in the movie,but while wathcing they are all invisible,when it ends,you can feel them strongly.

This is the movie that taught all non-gangsters how that world really is and what it is like to be involved with the family. Some of the best crew was put together, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton to name a few and it was all brilliantly directed by Francis Ford Coppola."
5589,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s The Godfather is more than just a film-it is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Based on Mario Puzo&#39;s novel, the movie explores themes of power, loyalty, and family in the world of organized crime.<br/><br/>At the heart of the story is the Corleone family, led by the aging patriarch Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in an iconic performance). His reluctant son, Michael (Al Pacino), undergoes a compelling transformation from a war hero uninterested in the family business to a ruthless mafia leader. This character arc is one of the most fascinating in film history, brilliantly portrayed by Pacino.<br/><br/>The film is a masterclass in storytelling, cinematography, and character development. Coppola&#39;s direction, combined with Nino Rota&#39;s haunting score and Gordon Willis&#39; moody cinematography, creates an immersive experience. Every scene is meticulously crafted, from the chilling opening sequence to the gripping finale.<br/><br/>What makes The Godfather exceptional is its balance between crime drama and a deeply personal family saga. The film humanizes its characters while never glorifying their violent world. With standout performances, memorable dialogue, and a powerful narrative, The Godfather remains one of the greatest films ever made."

1628,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn&#39;t have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There&#39;s scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don&#39;t forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I&#39;ve seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I&#39;m still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there&#39;s no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and Marlon Brando&#39;s performance is absolutely flawless."

I thank Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for this film and I hope we will see Coppola back in action soon. The acting as well is brilliant and Marlon Brando as the godfather,he is just amazing.This film only recieved three Oscars and it should have got more. This is a film about the mob or the &quot;cosa nostra&quot; but it is also a film about family and friendship.It`s a very touching film and a very beautiful film. This is the ultimate film and I love it. So it doesn`t get any better than this and to all of you out there who haven`t seen it,you don`t know what you`re missing. This is the BEST!!!!"
1958,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;The Godfather,&quot; directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an unparalleled cinematic masterpiece that transcends time and genre. Released in 1972, this film adaptation of Mario Puzo&#39;s novel is a tour de force in storytelling, character development, and cinematography. Marlon Brando&#39;s portrayal of Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino&#39;s transformation as Michael Corleone are performances etched into the annals of film history, while the film&#39;s exploration of power, loyalty, and the complex dynamics of a crime family continues to captivate audiences across generations. Clocking in at nearly three hours, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a meticulously crafted epic that unfolds with precision, drawing viewers into the Corleone family&#39;s world and its intricate power struggles within the organized crime underworld."
4700,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema. This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it&#39;s so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions. Thanks for making this movie."
5361,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Great Acting dreadful editing.
It&#39;s one of those must see movies but its just over rated.
Watch the horse&#39;s head scene and see how badly edited it is...terrible seeing as everyone holds it in such high regard. Wobbly sound and out of focus cuts throughout. Coppola should be ashamed."
3487,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I don&#39;t know how I had not watched this film until just a week ago, but I&#39;m glad because this is not a movie to watch with distractions or when you are too young because you will not enjoy it as much as an adult does. I saw this movie and immediately become an addict, watched it at least 3 more times the same week. There is so much to talk about it! I found it hard to think someone doesn&#39;t enjoying this one. The cast, the great dialogue, big plot twists, all the emotions, everything makes it just great. This is no a film as many of these times that need a 4K quality to be appealing, you will not waste your time, every minute of the almost 3 hours is worth. You will want even more.
If you haven&#39;t watch it, what are you waiting for? (&quot;This is an offer you can&#39;t refuse&quot;)"

1524,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I was present when the filming of the Horse&#39;s head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse&#39;s head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don&#39;s relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50&#39; of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a &quot;rookie&quot; to the making of &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the &quot;Gold Coast&quot; of Long Island. One was the new version of &quot;Sabrina&quot;, starring Harrison Ford....PS I never saw Marlon Brando, I think other scenes were done in Staten Island, part of NYC....thanks..."
4509,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Direction and Production
As a passionate film enthusiast, I can&#39;t help but marvel at the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. His ability to craft an immersive narrative that captivates the audience from the very first scene is truly exceptional. Coppola&#39;s talent for developing complex, multifaceted characters is evident in every frame, using cinematography that shifts between light and shadow to symbolize the moral duality of the characters. His choice to shoot many scenes in dimly lit interiors adds a tone of mystery and danger, underscoring the clandestine nature of the Corleone family&#39;s activities.<br/><br/>The production of &quot;The Godfather&quot; also stands out for its meticulous attention to detail and authenticity. The recreation of mid-20th century New York is flawless, from the costumes and sets to the music selection, which includes traditional Italian pieces that add an extra layer of realism and emotion to the narrative.<br/><br/>Performances
The performances in &quot;The Godfather&quot; are nothing short of legendary. Marlon Brando, as Vito Corleone, delivers an iconic performance that defines the mafia patriarch with a blend of toughness and humanity. His portrayal earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor, cementing his place in cinematic history. Brando manages to convey an imposing authority while showing a touching vulnerability, especially in scenes with his family.<br/><br/>Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, undergoes a masterful transformation from a reluctant, innocent young man to a calculating mafia boss. The evolution of his character is handled with impressive subtlety, and his ability to convey deep internal changes with minimal facial expressions showcases his immense talent. Michael&#39;s relationship with his family, especially his father Vito, is the emotional core of the film and is executed with an authenticity that deeply resonates with the audience.<br/><br/>Script and Themes
The script, co-written by Coppola and Puzo, is a work of art in itself. It balances the complexity of organized crime with family dynamics, presenting a story that is both intimate and epic. The dialogues are sharp and memorable, filled with lines that have become part of cultural lexicon, like &quot;I&#39;ll make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse.&quot;<br/><br/>The themes of &quot;The Godfather&quot; are universal and timeless. The film explores power and corruption, the cost of leadership and loyalty, and the struggle between family duty and personal ambition. These themes, presented with emotional depth and rich narrative, make the film transcend its genre to become a meditation on human nature and society.<br/><br/>Legacy
As a lifelong fan of cinema, I can&#39;t overstate the impact &quot;The Godfather&quot; has had on popular culture and the film industry. It has influenced countless movies and TV series, setting a standard for crime and family stories. Its critical and commercial success, with multiple Academy Awards, is a testament to its enduring quality.<br/><br/>In summary, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a cinematic masterpiece that combines visionary direction, exceptional performances, and an impeccable script to create a powerful and emotionally resonant narrative. It is a film that remains relevant and cherished, a true gem of the seventh art that continues to inspire generations of filmmakers and viewers. For anyone who loves cinema as much as I do, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is not just a movie-it&#39;s an experience, a benchmark, and a timeless classic."
1794,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I finally got a chance to see this movie. I tried to watch it with an open mind, without letting the hype dilute an even slight bit of impartiality - and I just can&#39;t say it&#39;s a very good movie. Perchance if soap opera was its own category, this may stand true to its title as &quot;#1&quot; on the IMDb.<br/><br/>   It perplexes me how people can call this landmark moviemaking when they probably have not seen works from other directors - Kurosawa, Truffaut, Lang... - all of whom had a much better eye than Coppolla. Most of these greats are now forgotten, with the exceptions of occasional screenings at film schools where one discovers that the Contemporary filmmaking style overseas  (1950s and 1960s)  was duplicated by American directors in the 1970s. <br/><br/> So what was wrong with this movie? Nonexistent or loose plot: No suspense, climax, excitement, or outcome. I thought the acting/characters were forgettable. Any other actor could have pulled off what Brando did and the fact they went through all that trouble to make him 10 or 20 year older just proves they shot for name recognition. <br/><br/> There were only a few things that I remember in this 3 hours of triviality: the &quot;offer you can&#39;t refuse&quot; line, Don Vito collapsing in a garden while a child obliviously plays, Caan&#39;s Santino character getting holed up, and bullets consistently going into foreheads. Maybe the artful yet repellent depiction of gratuitous violence is what made this such a masterpiece. But style without substance does not a good movie make.<br/><br/> For those who say &quot;oh, you just didn&#39;t get it, see it again&quot;, please get your mind out of the gutter - stop basing your opinions on what you&#39;re conditioned to like. <br/><br/>The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes, big time. End of review."
2324,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It&#39;s a truly incredible movie. I always postponed watching it until today. I wish I had watched it before. The movie is so absorbing, both with its script and acting, that you cannot get out of its influence even after the movie ends. One of the best movies of those times. All the emotions and events are handled so beautifully that the performances of the actors are not even a matter of course. A movie that every person should watch before they die. It&#39;s a movie that still holds its own despite all these years. I definitely recommend you watch it. The acting, especially of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, was magnificent."
4032,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather Review by FUTURE TV (Al Carlson)<br/><br/>The Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.<br/><br/>The Godfather revolves around the Corleone&#39;s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone&#39;s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn&#39;t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo&#39;s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo&#39;s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.<br/><br/>The characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don&#39;s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It&#39;s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.<br/><br/>Directer Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola&#39;s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. <br/><br/>This film should be immediately followed up by it&#39;s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They&#39;re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won&#39;t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven&#39;t seen this movie yet, it&#39;s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can&#39;t refuse."
3686,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;The Godfather&quot; is a timeless masterpiece that captivates audiences with its intense storytelling, unforgettable characters, and iconic performances. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film dives deep into the intricate world of organized crime, focusing on the powerful Corleone family. Marlon Brando&#39;s portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is legendary, bringing a complex mix of authority and vulnerability to the screen. The film&#39;s narrative, exploring themes of loyalty, family, and power, is both compelling and thought-provoking. The cinematography and score are outstanding, creating a rich and immersive atmosphere that draws viewers into the mafia underworld. &quot;The Godfather&quot; stands as a cinematic triumph, setting a high standard for storytelling and character development. Its influence on popular culture and the gangster genre is undeniable, making it a must-watch for any film enthusiast."
785,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"It&#39;s a masterpiece film that will have a value all the times. Some critics think after years of adulation and promotions from fans, that Shawshank Redemption has gotten overrated. In my opinion, I think they are wrong. Never have I been so moved by film. Its intriguing without being vague, intellectual without being conceited, long without ever losing pace but most of all what all art should be inspiring. I left feeling emotionally enlightened, enriched and equally drained. Breathtaking. The score was composed by Thomas Newman was stunning. The main theme (&quot;End Titles&quot; on the soundtrack album) is perhaps best known to modern audiences as the inspirational sounding music from many movie trailers dealing with inspirational, dramatic, or romantic films. Shawshank Redemption is like wine I guess, the older it becomes the better it becomes, really bizarre how it didn&#39;t appeal much at the time 1994, it was pretty hard to beat Forrest Gump, and Pulp Fiction that year. It end up having a cult following, after years and years of being aired on cable television to the point. A lot amount of people have finally view it, and most of the time share the same opinion, it was great. You have two hours to dig into the story - and I can tell you it was worth it. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film directed by Frank Darabont tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is sent to Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman), and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. It wasn&#39;t until he meets Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) does he heard that another inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy&#39;s innocence. It was here that Andy makes a choice, continue to live with the sins in prison, or clean himself up by escaping it. The film wasn&#39;t about a grand scheme of plot. It was unusual in the sense that it didn&#39;t matter what happens, but only that the message is fulfilled: Fear can set you prisoner, hope can set you free. And it did fulfill it. Brilliantly. It is the script and the actors that make this movie so great. Morgan Freeman as Red is the highlight of the film. Before Freeman was cast, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford were each considered for the role. Although the part was described as written as a middle-aged Irishman with graying red hair, Darabont cast Freeman for his authoritative presence and demeanor. Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor and his narrationing voice is so soothing. While I do like the narrations. Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up holes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist&#39;s inner feelings and thought. Here, it conveys Red who is basically telling us what we are witnessing on the screen. While, I do like it, it wasn&#39;t really needed. The acting of Tim Robbins was great as well. I love the scene where he play a recording of Mozart&#39;s The Marriage of Figaro on the loudspeaker. Still, in some scenes, he&#39;s too wooden and stiff. Furthermore, he mumbles too much. Both, Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner turn down the role, two actors I do like. I also love Bob Gunton as the Warden, but I really wanted James Crowell as the Warden. I thought it would be amazing to have him in this film. There are some many themes and messages, it&#39;s hard to count. The biggest one is the fundamental pillars of human life: hope. Some critics do have a problem with the film in some areas like attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers. It didn&#39;t help that 2007, two inmates of Union County Prison escaped from their prison using similar techniques to those featured in the movie. I think the biggest fault, is that white collar crime pays if you are slick. While Andy was innocent of the murders, he wasn&#39;t innocent in white collar crimes. Another thing that some critics nitpick is the deep emotional relationship between two men. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with it, thinking it as two men being friends. Some people say it&#39;s a homosexual relationship since in prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is clear throughout the film, not only through the characters of the sisters gang, but how inmates&#39; referral to new arrivals as &quot;fresh fish.&quot; There was also a lot of homosexual symbolism like the Rita Hayworth poster covering up something and how the sewer scene was a symbol for anal sex. If that&#39;s isn&#39;t weird enough, some critics have spotted many allegorical themes in the film, generally along the lines that Andy Dufresne is a latter day Jesus Christ. No matter what people see in it; even with some prison film clichés, it still a great film. I do like the 1963&#39;s &#39;Great Escape&quot; references with the socks. I don&#39;t want to spoil anything, but all I can say is, &quot;I&#39;m glad I took the time to watch this movie&quot;. Overall you build an understanding and feel for the characters, was real sad when certain characters died, really gets to you. The whole concept was smart, it just shocks how it was all put together and it works so well. Brilliant movie. Recommend anyone to watch it at least once in their life time. Don&#39;t take my word for it. Just watch it. So Get busy living or Get busy dying."
50,tt0068646,The Godfather,"A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly!This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone&#39;s acting was perfect.
To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy."
3547,tt0068646,The Godfather,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, That have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I&#39;ve seen, so much so I couldn&#39;t think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn&#39;t see this film before now.<br/><br/>True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.<br/><br/>The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.<br/><br/>Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse&#39;s head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino&#39;s casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.<br/><br/>In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating."
3561,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Could it get any better than the Godfather? Classic film with iconic plot twists, incredible performances and an overall feeling of &quot;familia&quot;...no wonder it stands the test of time. The performers were at the top of their games in this one. Maybe they should make a modern- day follow up. I mean, they are remaking everything else. Why not? Need a writer? Let me know! :)"
2812,tt0068646,The Godfather,"A great masterpiece made by Coppola 50 years ago, a great movie. The most important feature is that it is a natural film and it is a reflection of the Italian people to talk about the mafia work in America without causing any trouble.
A big movie that brings big actors to the cinema (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall)"
287,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i&#39;ve ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really &quot;Red&quot;. Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema&#39;s industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact."
719,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"It is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever seen. It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times. Story telling, acting, directing, anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done. I believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is, you are at the correct address. The atmosphere in the prison, the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movie; there is nothing to say. It is just exceptionally plain good. A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart."
5636,tt0068646,The Godfather,Such a boring movie. I&#39;m a very well established psychiatrist and I was disgusted and bewildered by the lack of care the characters had for themselves in this film. What on earth was Michael Corleone doing not taking antidepressants?! Michael was a very depressed character and the fact he didn&#39;t seem to take any antidepressants in this film baffles me as I thought that would&#39;ve been obvious for him to do.<br/><br/>Antidepressants may be undertested a lot and may frequently make people infertile but it&#39;s totally worth it if it means stopping a potential suicide of someone like Michael. I&#39;m disgusted with this movie and my heart ached for the Autistic man known as Michael Corleone to get help and good drugs from a pharmacy in this movie.
5664,tt0068646,The Godfather,It&#39;s the Mona Lisa of the films and cult film that never will be old. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino adopt their role and they&#39;ve contributed to the art to the that cinema era.
2287,tt0068646,The Godfather,Probably the best movie ever made. This kind of movies you can watch over and over without getting bored
1117,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I still remember the first time I saw this movie. The storyline is never ordinary, always surprise me. And the actor team are so impressive"
4353,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Totally superb from acting to directing to plot to dialogue.  Definitely in my top 10 list and a joy to watch over and over again.  To be fair there are a few negatives.  At times it is difficult to understand what Marlon Brando is saying.  Also, having read the book, there are some interesting characters and sub-plots that are hardly developed in either this move or the sequel.  The character of Luca Bracci was never fully appreciated in the movie and he appears almost to be a buffoon.  In the book he is an incredibly feared individual that had wiped out some competing mobs single handedly.  You could say he was the Michael Jordan of hitmen.<br/><br/>The character of Lucy was just seen as a tramp used by Santino in the movie where she was a fairly interesting character as well as Johnny Fontaine. Anyone who has seen the movie should also read the book to understand what I mean."
5379,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Money or materialism is the embodiment of human greed and the way the gangsters go about their lives, breaking laws and committing barbaric animalistic acts of terror just for money is a poor cultural showcase to people around the world. I give it a 3 out of 10 as the characters at least dress well and have some sense of professionalism though twisted as it is.<br/><br/>The plot is actually quite simple and basic for a movie with such a high rating, there&#39;s a few thought provoking lines but other than that it&#39;s just the case of lawless organisations pitted against each other for the sake of money so if a mindless violent movie obsessing over money obsessed gangs is your thing then go for it and cheer your heart out for the amounts of money the rich mafia firms you imagine stole or received."
5313,tt0068646,The Godfather,"1. Haircuts completely wrong in that 1970&#39;s manner. James Caan, for example.<br/><br/>2. Clothes ditto.<br/><br/>3. Nothing personal, but Brando was a ham.<br/><br/>4. Al Pacino simply does not have the physical presence, at least not then. In the &#39;gangster&#39; suits and hats he looks ridiculous, not important or scary.<br/><br/>5. Extravagant son-et-lumieres do not an epic make.<br/><br/>6. For its time, The Godfather was a refreshing change from the regular fare of 1972 with some good catchphrases, that&#39;s all.<br/><br/>7. Greater than the sum of its parts because it&#39;s lush, visually and musically; but actually there&#39;s not much holding the set pieces together."
245,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Thanx to everybody who helped to put Shawshank back to rank 2 in the top 250, in front of LotR3, where it belongs. I&#39;ve seen this movie about 20 times and I never get tired of it. That&#39;s what makes a movie the best. The first 2 in the top 250 are where they belong. The 3 LotR-movies should be out of the top 10. They should create a category for special effects. Put them on top there. But for a great movie it need a lot more then effects. The story of Shawshank is absolutely great. The actors did their best. It&#39;s still a shame, that this great movie didn&#39;t got a single Oscar. It could have win the best picture in most years against all winners."
3995,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is basically the gangster film that everyone else tries to copy, but they just can&#39;t touch it. It&#39;s about the Corleones, this big-time mafia family trying to hold onto power in a world that&#39;s kinda out to get them. You&#39;ve got Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, who is just this total boss. Seriously, the guy barely raises his voice, and everyone listens!<br/><br/>Then there&#39;s Michael, played by young Al Pacino, who starts off just trying to be the &quot;normal&quot; one in the family but gets pulled into the whole mafia life. His journey is wild - by the end, he&#39;s basically the last person you&#39;d want to mess with.<br/><br/>The whole vibe of the movie is dark and intense. Every scene feels like it has a deeper meaning. And the music? Iconic! Even if you haven&#39;t seen it, you probably know the main theme. It&#39;s not just about action; it&#39;s got heart, drama, family stuff, and a whole lot of &quot;what-would-you-do&quot; moments. If you haven&#39;t seen it, just do yourself a favor and watch it."
2549,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for &quot;gangster movies&quot;, but its influence goes well beyond that.<br/><br/>The Godfather&#39;s influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every &quot;organized crime film&quot; nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public&#39;s imagination.<br/><br/>But to say that The Godfather is simply &quot;influential&quot; is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as &quot;a movie about gangsters&quot;. The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.<br/><br/>As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors&#39; performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.<br/><br/>The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone&#39;s daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don&#39;s power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.<br/><br/>However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone&#39;s ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.<br/><br/>To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito&#39;s younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his &quot;innocence&quot; and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.<br/><br/>I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.<br/><br/>There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra&#39;s real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won&#39;t go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.<br/><br/>The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.<br/><br/>The Godfather certainly doesn&#39;t need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends."
2404,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Marlon Brando&#39;s acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.<br/><br/>However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It&#39;s just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.<br/><br/>Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven&#39;t seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.<br/><br/>7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it."
2377,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Where do I begin? The soundtrack, the acting, the pacing, world building, everything! Writing a review for this absolute MASTERPIECE is quite the daunting task. Al Pacino really stood out among the cast members. The way he portrays a man&#39;s slip into madness is pure gold. The soundtrack is iconic, catchy, and it fits the movie perfectly. This piece of cinema is only second to The Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa in my book. Not only that, but the writing is perfect! The dialogue is unlike almost anything seen before at the time. You feel as it you get to know the characters of this film in real life! This gets an obvious 10/10 and recommendation from me. You MUST watch this movie! It will change your perspective on the art of cinema."
2343,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is crap...it&#39;s a long movie about nothing. I would rather die than watch that crap again...notice crap is written more than a few times? That&#39;s because, this is what this movie is...CRAP! The acting is bad, the sets are bad. Overall this is junk. How in the world it&#39;s number one on the top 250 is beyond me. You people must have nothing better to do than to watch a movie where people get killed off because they opened their mouths or voiced their thoughts. I can watch that on the news. I hate this movie so much that my roommates are watching it right now, and I have my CD player on as loud as it will go, because I hate this movie! So in closing...The Godfather, all of them, are crap!"
218,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I can&#39;t say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film. Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry, but I found it utterly average.  I am afraid I just didn&#39;t get what was so fantastic about the movie.  Don&#39;t get me wrong it was an entertaining film but not the masterpiece I was lead to believe it was. Sorry."
5532,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Best movie I&#39;ve ever seen. In Vietnam, there are also movies about godfathers, but not like this, this movie will definitely be an immortal movie. You should watch this movie once in your life. It has a lot to learn."
3263,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In order to grasp the true depth of this movie - you have to read the novel. It&#39;s mandatory. To understand the Corleone s, the era in which they flourished &amp; the times in which Vito made Don !!<br/><br/>Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando is the greatest portrayal of a fictional character on screen. No one could have played him better.<br/><br/>The adapted screenplay is optimally redesigned to keep the movie fast paced, gripping &amp; electric with the fair share of thrills.<br/><br/>In one scene, outside the hospital waiting for men, Michael examines his hand. It isn&#39;t shaking in spite of the fear. As in the novel, he is beginning to realize, he has a unique calm about him in times of grave danger.<br/><br/>That is a magnificent scene, one only Coppola could have directed.<br/><br/>I can go on and on and on .. each scene is a monument of artistry. <br/><br/>Watch this movie before you die !!!<br/><br/>PS: Read the novel first ...."
2540,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie deserves either pages of analytics and insight or else the simplest of all reviews, and I opt for the latter.

Watching the whole gang, Brando, Duvall, Pacino, Caan and the others, you just, for a few hours, forget you are watching a movie. You are sucked into their world of intrigues, love-affairs and family-business. If there is some out there who hasn&#39;t seen the movie, for some VERY strange reason, I can guarantee you, that you have missed out on the greatest movie of all time. Sure Citizen Kane was great, and so was The Shawshank Redemption, but let&#39;s be real... There is NO comparison to The Godfather. Whether you like gangster-movies or not, this is one you can&#39;t miss!!!"
5100,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a Ameerican crime film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy with a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a New York crime family, the story covers the years 1945-1955, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone who later became a ruthless Mafia boss with Vito as the head of the Corleone Family.<br/><br/>Based on Puzo&#39;s best-selling novel of the same name, The Godfather is generally considered one of the greatest films in world cinema, and also one of the most influential films, especially in the Gangster genre. Second only to Citizen Kane being torn down by the American Film Institute in 2007, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.<br/><br/>The film is the highest-grossing film ever made, and remained the box office leader in 1972. The film won three Oscars that year: Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Nominations in seven other categories include Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success of this film gave birth to two follow-up films: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."
1581,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I can understand on why &quot;The Godfather&quot; is being regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, if not the greatest by some professionals. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is the soul of a perfected cinema, one that will be looked upon by passionate students, and one that will be studied for generations. It is the ultra-American movie classic, which shares its place alongside movies like &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Even its formidable sequel never holds the same kind of stature. To admire &quot;The Godfather&quot;, is to celebrate American cinema, or just simply movies.<br/><br/>Some time ago, I told a friend that &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a great example of a &#39;complete&#39; movie, and my opinion stays in that manner still. It has everything a movie requires: cinematography, acting, editing, screenplay, directing and obviously, a glorious plot. &#39;Overrated&#39; is the term adopted by some for &quot;The Godfather&quot;, and my assumption is that either he dislikes the picture, or he lacks the understanding to realise the wonders of the medium. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is the first great film I caught. It is the initiator of my love for cinema. Undoubtedly, the film will always have a special place in my heart.<br/><br/>What began and seemed like a happy family, plunges into darkness too quickly. The joy and light at the beginning are merely silhouettes of the Corleone family. Sonny&#39;s (James Caan) trifling with adultery, and the show of his temper, a man asking for murder, an unholy loyalty, and Michael&#39;s (Al Pacino) telling of his father&#39;s ways of abusing power - all these are signs shown by Coppola on the dangers that will rain down upon them. One who flirts with sin, will face a punishment.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who is the head of the family, is a very powerful and influential figure. With considerable loyalty that his friends pay for him, he holds the power to accomplish his ambitions. &quot;The Godfather&quot; serves introductions to the Corleone family, and only with the arrival of a narcotic baron, a spark of its drama, lighted. Although Vito portrays the main character of the story, I treat it such that the Corleone family is the &#39;protagonist&#39; instead, with their businesses and goals are the greatest displays of the story.<br/><br/>My favourite moment is a scene where Michael places his sick father in a hidden room to avoid a possible assassination. And Vito&#39;s tears flow down his cheek upon discovering that his son, has performed with utmost sincerity to keep him safe. That part, clearly magnified a genuine father-son relationship and too, the sheer love that Vito has for Michael and also a magnificent clue that Michael is the right person to succeed his father as the head of the family. No matter how villainous, or powerful or influential Vito may be, he is still an ordinary father who preserves love for his children.<br/><br/>The movie opens up relationships between the people in the family. To witness Sonny embracing his brother, Michael, before the disinclined departure, says a lot about the soft spoken allegiance he has for Michael. And also it brings to light about loyalty and protectiveness within. Not only the story painted picture of aggressiveness of the organisation, but also about characters, that men carry.<br/><br/>James Caan, John Cazale, Robert Duvall and the rest from the cast delivers perfect performances that have made &quot;The Godfather&quot; to be inarguably one of the best acted films in history. Marlon might already have passed terrific performances for his earlier movies like &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, but his work for the &quot;The Godfather&quot; transcended all these. His embodiment of an old, fading Don gives life for excellence and the body of an acting genius. Al Pacino is responsible for the convincing but subtle transformation of Michael from an innocent war hero, to a cold, hard – hitting Don. That effortless changeover by Pacino is a marvellous piece of acting. John Marley is terrific as the outspoken movie producer but a very short screen time was given for him, and his performance is severely underrated.<br/><br/>There is &quot;The Godfather&quot;, living under the shades of cinematic greatness. The legacy and influence that the movie brings, endures till today. It is pretty much ironic that the greatest gangster movie is actually the one that romanticises the subject, not the ones that vomit the brutalities that many find a strong connection in between. Coppola made a statement that sounds like the movie is actually &quot;an accidental success&quot;. I refuse to believe in that. I believe that the geniuses of Coppola, the actors, the writer and the filmmakers involved, that have had truly made &quot;The Godfather&quot; a timeless masterpiece.<br/><br/>(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com) twitter: @Alex_DeSmall"

1101,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; has so much skill which went into the production that it is regrettable that it&#39;s overlength undermines its attributes. Episodic, slack and slow formatting stretch the narrative far beyond what its material requires. The result is a fair film, with some worthy touches."
2202,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It was only while reading the book earlier this year that I realised how much of this film had stuck with me. I watched it once as a teenager and despite not fully understanding it, the scenes stuck in my brain unlike most movies. The book is surprisingly worse, to be sure, but it does in a way embellish the film upon return.<br/><br/>What isn&#39;t surprising is how fantastic The Godfather truly is. It goes through the great range of human emotions across sturdy, well-plotted rails. Endless stories about what it took to get this vision on screen are well known by many, and the effort shows brighter than ever.<br/><br/>Truly magnifico, one of the great epics of American storytelling. I can&#39;t say anything that hasn&#39;t already been said."
36,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Up until today, I haven&#39;t bothered to review &quot;The Godfather&quot;. After all, everyone pretty much knows it&#39;s one of the greatest films ever made. It&#39;s #2 on IMDb&#39;s Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what&#39;s one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it&#39;s time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn&#39;t watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it&#39;s 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I&#39;ll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it&#39;s violent and nasty in spots--but it&#39;s also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it&#39;s received.<br/><br/>My advice is that instead of just watching &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Godfather: Part II&quot;, see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."
1595,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn&#39;t depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. <br/><br/>The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won&#39;t be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.<br/><br/>The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
724,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"It&#39;s the best plot ever
this film is one of the best films that made my day i watched it over 20 times and i learned many things from it every time i watched it"
807,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,Amazing movie - great direction - professional actors - not overrated it deserve to be where it is. This movie comes is my all time favorite movie list.
4801,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Reducing a fat, thick, best-selling novel to manageable screenplay terms has always been a major problem for any filmmaker blessed (or cursed) with the assignment. What do you include? What do you leave out? Perhaps even more important, how do you cast to anticipate the expectations of the millions who have already read the book? <br/><br/>They did it to the fullest!"
5153,tt0068646,The Godfather,"There&#39;s no need to praise this movie anymore than it has been. Instead, I&#39;d like to bring attention to the relevance it has to the crime genre. When we think of the &#39;tropes&#39; of the organized crime genre in cinema, a lot of writers and directors pull from this movie franchise. I&#39;ve even come across the tropes in the Godfather in foreign movies and series about organized crime.<br/><br/>I&#39;d say without a doubt it is the Founding Father of the Genre."
419,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This picture is a rip-off from the Clint Eastwood movie called &quot; Escape from Alcatraz&quot; When you watch it carefully you&#39;ll notice the similarity between the two of them. And not only this movie is a rip-off , the Clint Eastwood&#39;s movie is also a stolen idea from the movie called &quot; A Man Escaped &quot; an old classic french movie."
3417,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Ten years ago when I watched this movie for the first time I had no knowledge of English and I was almost a kid. My first impression of the movie was that it was plain boring. I have just watched &quot;The Godfather&quot; again ten years later. I am about to be twenty-seven years-old and I am a professor of English as a second language in two universities of my country so I can no longer think that my impression of the movie is biased by my young age or my lack of understanding of English -oh, I also speak Italian by the way.<br/><br/>This movie is simply way too overrated. I am not saying this is a bad movie but it does NOT deserve his current position as 2nd greatest movie of all times.<br/><br/>If you have not watched this movie I invite you to do so and judge for yourself. If you have watched it already I would like for you to try and convince me that I am wrong. If you decide to do so, I would appreciate if you did it in a respectful way.<br/><br/>Regards, MANIUIS."
2924,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show &quot;Sopranos&quot;. But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.<br/><br/>Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn&#39;t hold back.<br/><br/>The performances are awesome and I can&#39;t wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I&#39;ll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don&#39;t agree with the way the &quot;family&quot; functions (and you shouldn&#39;t agree with it of course, just saying)"
2109,tt0068646,The Godfather,Coppola and Maria Puzo take you on a journey through the shadiness of the mafia world where we witness the greatest character arcs ever. The cinematography and camera placement of this movie are what makes it different from conventional gangster films.
1527,tt0068646,The Godfather,Superb movie i remember i watched when i was in college.
897,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"You gotta watch this movie, don&#39;t waste your time looking for another one. Trust me"
5429,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One of the best ever movies i watched, wish to have same movies now a days"
4224,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Title says it all.... This movie was long, and cut out the best parts of the book.  It had a good cast, but that can&#39;t make up for poor transition from the novel. Bottom line: read the book, it&#39;s better."
3765,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is known for being one of the best films ever made and i have to agree.The performances in the film are amazing,from the raspy-voiced Marlon Brando to the amazing Al Pacino.And Despite the fact that the film is over three hours long it compels you through the whole thing.<br/><br/>The Godfather is about an old Don of the Corleone Mafia Family(Marlon Brando).His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael&#39;s sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael&#39;s family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don&#39;s lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.<br/><br/>This film is a work of art that remains to this day one of the the best film ever made.<br/><br/>10/10(i wish that i can give it higher)"
2174,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I re-watched it today. My rating reflects that I feel it is over long, and not as vital as it may have seemed to audiences in 1972. Parts of it, in fact, are actually boring. Other scenes, particularly where their is action or violence, seem dated. On the plus side, Brando gives a mostly fascinating performance, and some of the supporting actors are also quite good. I especially liked Robert Duvall and Abe Vigoda. Apart from the acting, their is one section of the film that I did find riveting. It is when they prepare Michael to kill The Turk and the police chief. It is tense and suspenseful, and is the closest the movie comes to noir."
126,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"i watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don&#39;t know why but the movie&#39;s end, couldn&#39;t stop myself..<br/><br/>andy&#39;s portrayal by tim robbins and red&#39;s by morgan freeman was absolutely great..<br/><br/>i like and love andy&#39;s philosophy that &quot;hope is a good thing..&quot; .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn&#39;t it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i&#39;m sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time.."
786,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is the best movie of all times according to over a million voters. When I saw this movie I was amazed because of the plot of this movie and that was something that made this movie so special.<br/><br/>I also liked this movie very much because of the cast of this movie. Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (Ellis Boyd &#39;Red&#39; Redding) made one of the best performances of their life. Deserves to be noted that Bob Gunton (Warden Norton) made an also good performance.<br/><br/>I really recommend this movie to you and I am sure that you will love it because it&#39;s a movie that can teach you many things about life and the relationships between people and friends.
2438,tt0068646,The Godfather,the worst movie by one of the greatest director. I rented this movie because of the reviews. I was thoroughly disappointed with the garbage i wasted my time on. No Plot to hold on to throughout the movie.
5371,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I have had this movie for many months but i never got time to watch it. Yesterday i did and i think ,like everybody say ,it is one of the best movies made ever. Al Pacino who was not very popular at that time make his breakthrough performance and he is just great in the role of Michael Corleone. About the legend Marlon Brando,he is just phenomenal,his facial expressions and husky voice just make his role one of the best characters. It is based on Mario Puzo&#39;s novel about five fictional mafia families and Must say he did a great job on screenplay too. There are some great as well as shocking scenes in this movie i.e. When Woltz wake up and finds a real severed head of a horse. Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo. Prolonged fight between Connie and Carlo. Death of Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone. Death scene of Sonny ambushed by gang members at toll. The killings of all the other heads of Mafia families,Moe Green,Tesiso and Carlo. I loved the setting and style. James Caan,Richard S. Castellano,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton &amp; Talia Shire did great jobs too. Despite the many Anachronisms,this movie is just marvelous. I have read everything that Coppola dis to make this movie so outstanding. Maybe the best gangster movie ever made. Thanks Paramount,Francis Ford Coppola and every Cast-crew member related for producing this chef-d&#39;oeuvre."
5526,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Perhaps the greatest movie ever made. Growing up i watched this movie more than a hundred times, and still.. never ceases to amaze me.<br/><br/>The honor and morality of ruthless kilers, the cold and in the same time warm atmosphere. The clash between the top actors (Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall) and the newcomers (Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, John Casale, James Caan). This movie is a school in acting and directing, and a pure sample of how a flawless movie should be.<br/><br/>Everything perfect."
565,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"One of the best movies ever,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were so good."
5368,tt0068646,The Godfather,"After watching The Godfather, I searched for films to compete and compare this film, but I did not find it, and I expect that I will not find a better one. This film I make sure that everyone I know watches it. Even with the greatness of the second part, I see the first part as greater than it, even though they are all great. I am now continuing to watch the movie to confirm that there is nothing better than it. I watched it five times and think of the sixth and seventh. For me, I classify three as the best of the Godfather trilogy, and this is thanks to the first part of it being great. And thanks."
418,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I&#39;d heard about this film a few years ago and I&#39;d heard it was good. I was lied to. This film wasn&#39;t good, It was outstanding! I can&#39;t believe I never watched this sooner! From the opening scenes where the mysterious Andy Dufresne is being dragged into hell to the credits as Red runs across the beach to him, this film was, in a word, Perfect! No holes to spot, almost everything was completely accurate, Probably some of the best script I&#39;ve ever heard and a brilliant story. Normally, If a film goes over two hours, I start to get a little bored and I end up wanting the film to end but this was completely the opposite! I never wanted this to end and the hefty 140 minutes get you wanting more and the story drew me in so much, I felt as if I was there. Normally with films adapted from Stephen King books, they don&#39;t do so well on the big screen but this has proved that wrong! Overall, I like this film because it&#39;s realistic, it goes into great depth and the story is so gripping, you can&#39;t take your eyes off the screen and this film will always be there at the top as one of my favourite films ever!"
3742,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Filmed over 30 years ago, i believe that The Godfather to this day, is simply the best movie ever made. To be honest, i think that before they make another movie this good, particularly in this genre, we will be watching it with our children&#39;s children...if we&#39;re lucky.<br/><br/>I had to watch The Godfather more than once to realise that this movie is actually more about family than the mafia or the underworld. Most of the vengeance and deaths in this movie are not caused by money or greed. They are for family. I must say i haven&#39;t seen a movie before that gives this much importance to family. Particularly Al Pacino&#39;s character - Michael does an unbelievable turn around when it comes to his family. It&#39;s just incredible. At first reluctant to get involved with the family business, Michael soon becomes more ambitious and tougher than everyone else, again only for his family.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie is non cliché makes it more enjoyable to watch. It&#39;s not predictable in a sense where the good guy wins and bad guy loses eventually. It&#39;s so much more realistic than that. I have nothing bad to say about the length, editing and definitely about the cast. Al Pacino especially just continues to surprise me with how good he portrays his character. He is no doubt the best actor in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Some people may find The Godfather very slow, dark and depressing. It&#39;s not the loudest and most &#39;vibrant&#39; movie, but that&#39;s kind of the whole point. I believe those people should then stop watching movies from this genre, because if you did not like this one...you won&#39;t like any. No words and reviews can do this movie justice and i believe that unlike some over rated, inflated movies The Godfather actually deserves its big reputation of being a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. without a doubt...10/10"
3997,tt0068646,The Godfather,We ca n get a lot of learnings on this movie. This film works so well because it is an underworld in which its not that visible if you don&#39;t really watch the whole movie. There are other movies as well that are similar to this idea but this specific movie has a lot going on. Our team has provided this feedback and review because we think that this is a legendary film that was created and until now a lot of people are still watching it. You can compare different stories from different movies but this one is so unique that will really stick to your mind for a very long time/ I hope others enjoy it as well.
2564,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I must admit, i&#39;ve never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i&#39;ve seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.<br/><br/>But i never get into it.<br/><br/>The plot is ok but i wanted more.<br/><br/>I wanted to go deeper into the &quot;why&quot; and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.<br/><br/>They just &quot;looked&quot; and there was silence.<br/><br/>I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called &quot;masterpiece&quot;. But it didn&#39;t happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly &quot;bored&quot;.<br/><br/>I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.<br/><br/>The characters are all not so relatable, i didn&#39;t felt their feelings.<br/><br/>Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn&#39;t even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/><br/>For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.<br/><br/>I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn&#39;t do it...that says a lot for myself."
916,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This was a great story when I read it. Usually movies don&#39;t live up to the book, but this one does. This movie stays true to the story, except for about 5 minutes added to the end of the movie. The story ends with red on the bus. But of course most movies need a better closing so they added the extra 5 minutes. Which of course doesn&#39;t hurt the movie at all. And of course it has an outstanding cast, which doesn&#39;t hurt the movie at all. I could sit and watch this movie every time it&#39;s on TV. I&#39;ve lost track of how many times I&#39;ve seen bits and pieces of this movie because I see that it&#39;s on while I&#39;m flipping the channels, and it&#39;s always hard to turn it off."
4511,tt0068646,The Godfather,Amazing movie i ever seen aeg aerg dv sezr dfv serv fv
4113,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Probably the greatest film of all times. This film is, in my opinion, absolutely perfect: Coppola&#39;s best direction, fantastic photography, perfectly acted by all the cast, thrilling story...<br/><br/>This cinema classic is a must-see film, from the beginning to the end. There are lots of influences from the genre classics, but it is at the same time original and surprising.<br/><br/>Its violence is brutal but not just for fun, there is just the necessary to show the criminal world, which is perfectly represented here.<br/><br/>This film is so great you can watch it more than one time, and you&#39;re not going to get tired of it. You&#39;ll find even more details in every scene, so it&#39;s a perfect film to have at home, because yo&#39;ll enjoy watching it a lot of times. I recommend the Blu-ray edition, which is really good."
3055,tt0068646,The Godfather,One of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. There is no better movie in your world than this movie
140,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,Nice title :) 10/10 best one i have seen my dude couldn&#39;t get any better
75,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Well I guess I&#39;m a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I&#39;ve seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, &quot;The Godfather&quot; was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I&#39;ve come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like &quot;On The Waterfront&quot;, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest&quot;. I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don&#39;t mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it&#39;s pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen&#39;s release and new prisoner Tommy&#39;s introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy&#39;s quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man&#39;s confinement for a crime he didn&#39;t commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967&#39;s &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;, but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.<br/><br/>But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that &#39;hope can drive a man insane&#39;.<br/><br/>I really can&#39;t recommend this picture highly enough, both for it&#39;s masterful story telling and it&#39;s technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that&#39;s virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance."
4120,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a pointless, noisy, mindless, violent excuse for a film. It just seems to be an excuse to use the &#39;f&#39; word for three hours. The acting is terrible and there is no story to be seen whatsoever. It seems to have been written by a three year old child. I give this film a 1/10 and that is being generous."
166,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!<br/><br/>Why? This was my question.<br/><br/>The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).<br/><br/>The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.<br/><br/>The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.<br/><br/>Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that&#39;s why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.<br/><br/>Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts."
3354,tt0068646,The Godfather,"In the second part of the godfather, the old godfather went to kill the hooligans who forced them to pay protection money on a religious holiday, and the process can be described as extremely calm and cold-blooded. When I got home, I hugged my little son and said, &quot;Michael, Daddy loves you very much.&quot;<br/><br/>All admit that the second part is more or no less than the first. Because this book repeatedly compares the difference between these two fathers and sons. The old godfather was forced by life to join the gang, but he was very sober, one of his purposes was for the family, and the other was as mentioned in the first part, he continued to show favor to unrelated people, and used this as a hedge to keep himself from being completely limited to darkness.<br/><br/>Michael is different, ambitious, wants to climb up, and will do anything to do it, and in the end Kai also leaves him, and his subordinates are also dissatisfied, and his brother is against him and betrays him. And, of course, there is the adversary, who, because he ruthlessly swept away all obstacles in his way and killed the Jew&#39;s friend, the Jew designed him. In the end, as always, he killed his elder brother and purged all those who stood in his way, those who betrayed him, including Jews, subordinates, his brother, and apparently the Pope.<br/><br/>When people reach this point, they are betrayed and divorced. So in the third part, he ended up very tragically, lost his daughter, and died in loneliness.<br/><br/>His father was different, he was hunted down by the mafia in his hometown when he was a teenager and fled to the United States to live at the bottom. Later, he did a little illegal business and was forced to pay protection money by hooligans. Then he went to assassinate the scoundrel. Three shots were fired, the first shot knocked down the hooligan, the second shot prevented the hooligan from counterattacking, and then the second shot in the head to ensure that the hooligan died. Unusually calm, methodical, and a masterpiece, but unfortunately there is no way out. Later, he used gentlemanly language to threaten a landlord not to increase the rent of the widow tenant."

Michael, Vito&#39;s youngest son and a decorated WWII Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don&#39;s influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito&#39;s fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart."
204,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"A sweet and sad story of hope. I really enjoyed this movie, it wast a fun movie but it didn&#39;t have to be. It was so excellently written and acted, I really cared for all the characters and was truly heartbroken when Brooks died. So much time was given for the characters to develop and build friendship. The ending had such a long build up and was so extremely satisfying. I love how life in prison was portrayed, it was very interesting and got me invested into the story straight away. I thought after Andy was wrongly accused that the movie would focus more on him not being guilty, but it turned away from that and being more unique. The warden was an excellent character as well, he seemed nice at the beginning but slowly became more and more villainous and it really shows when watching. The way everything links together throughout the story is amazing, I love all the connections between characters and plot. This movie is an absolute joy to watch 9/10"

5629,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, &quot;Oh that was 10 out of 10.&quot; If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone&#39;s early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn&#39;t even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.<br/><br/>A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don&#39;s younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.<br/><br/>I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.<br/><br/>Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy."
3369,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It is a perfect production in a word, both with its shooting and acting. It is truly incredible that the atmosphere of being able to live in the film, which cannot be made now despite the year it was made, was created in those years. You can learn a lot about life from this movie. If we need to examine the soundtrack of the movie, all the sound arguments in the movie, including the effects, are handled properly. I had goosebumps the first time I heard the music that reminded me of this movie when heard. When we examine the scene shots in detail, it is as if the mimics of Al Pachino, who plays the character of Michael, are watching through his eyes. I invite those who haven&#39;t watched it, no matter how old they are, to watch it...."
1484,tt0068646,The Godfather,"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn&#39;t believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. <br/><br/>All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.<br/><br/>Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He&#39;s also got a cash flow problem at the casino he&#39;s running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.<br/><br/>The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.<br/><br/>In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando&#39;s adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They&#39;re all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.<br/><br/>Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn&#39;t know that this was Frank Sinatra again you&#39;d have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.<br/><br/>The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse&#39;s head in John Marley&#39;s bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an &quot;offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot;, or &quot;Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes&quot; is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.<br/><br/>The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn&#39;t happy about the road he took for success, but it&#39;s what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn&#39;t to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it&#39;s beautifully played.<br/><br/>In fact it&#39;s all beautifully played."
2361,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This film is one of the best! The acting and the chemistry between them are amazing. In this film Tony Montana is Micheal Corleone, born as the last child of Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, the head of the Corleone family (Spoilers!: You see more of Vito&#39;s background in the second movie) , a big family in New York. But Micheal isn&#39;t like Tony, but though the movie he does some crimes for himself. The soundtrack blends really well with the sounds of the movie, you hear it but it isn&#39;t too loud, nor it&#39;s too low. Marlon and Al really make this movie. If you haven&#39;t seen it already, well buy it on Blue ray or watch it on Netflix. It gets only better when you seen all the trilogy."
3759,tt0068646,The Godfather,"There is no denying that the Godfather is a classic and one of the best movies ever made. It is a saga of a major Mafia father, the upper echelons and there struggles. It starts with Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) on the day of his daughter&#39;s wedding and doing favours for people invited to the wedding. The films shows the outcome of these favours, including the famous sense of the horse&#39;s head in the bed. The film then shows Vito refusing to take part in selling drugs and ends up having an assassination attempt against him. The Corleone family is forced into a tuft war before peace is made. At the same time the Godfather shows Michael&#39;s (Al Panico) rise in the family, from being a bit of an outsider not wanting to get involved to becoming the head of family after Vito&#39;s death. The film shows how person relationships developed and shows the characters as real people. It shows how the Mafia would have worked in the 1950s, focusing on deal making, rising up the ranks and showing acts of violence being conducted.<br/><br/>The gangster film was not a new genre, their were good films in the film noir period such as Scarface, Little Caesar and the Killing. However I am not aware of any major gangster films in the 60s. The Godfather focused on the characters and many different and complex plots and subplots. It was able to bring in more violence into the genre because by the late 60s films were allowed to show more violence. The film also benefits from a brilliant script, the excellent direction of Francis Ford Coppella (this film along with The Godfather Part II are his best films) and a brilliant cast. Marlon Brando was brought back into the mainstream after gaining a reputation for being an ego-maniac, and help made the careers of Al Panico, James Caan and Diane Keaton. This was also the first film I aware of focusing mainly on the Mafia and how it functions. I remember watching a document on the making of the film on Channel Four and how difficult it was for the filmmakers, fighting with the Italian-American community.<br/><br/>The Godfather and Godfather Part II are both classics and must watch films. I admit I have not watched Godfather Part III but that because I heard it wasn&#39;t as good and ruins the first two. It has been very influential in the gangster genre afterwards. They was Once Upon A Time in America which was similar in it approach, having many story lines and themes and similar filming of violence. They was Goodfellas which forced on foot-soldiers of the Mafia and set mainly in the 60s and 70s when it was filmed in the 80s. They are also films like Casino and American Gangster, the list goes on. They are also parodies such as Family Business and programmes such as the Simpsons, Futurama and Family Guy. Finally their was the Sopranos (one of the best programmes ever made), mixing elements of the Godfather and Goodfellas. All in all the Godfather is a very important film."
1593,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Personally, I found this movie to be quite overrated. Even though it was a good movie, I see very little that makes it great. The movie is long, and often long winded. The only standout that I see is Brando&#39;s incredible acting. Mr. Brando and Al Pacino both make this long film bearable."
3083,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I love that this scene establishes the entire theme of the films--which is family and relationships. The scene is basically &quot;this movie is about the mafia, but it&#39;s not John Wick and this is not about murder. And we are not hitmen. We are people who value our relationships&quot;"
1787,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is the 3rd time I watched this movie and it gave me the same chill , it gave me the first time.
At end when Alpachino is called &quot;Don Corleone&quot;.
Summaries the movie.
Loved Marlon Brando."
1391,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"this film is simply brilliant. the characters are all totally awesome and so are the actors who play them! also when watching this amazing film, you don&#39;t think to pick up on the little things until it all becomes clear! it truly is one of the best films that i have ever seen along side requiem for a dream and the lord of the rings trilogy. it is that good that when watching it, you forget that it is a film because you get so into the story and so in love with all of the characters. the men/women who wrote the script for this outstanding movie sensation is exceeding talented, as are all of the people involved in this production and they should all be proud of themselves for producing one of the top three greatest films of all time."
5490,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay written by Mario Puzo and Coppola. The movie is based on Italian-American Mafia member Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Bonanza&#39;s semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. It follows the story of Michael Corleone, a mafia kingpin who attempts to legitimize his criminal enterprise and keep his family from being torn apart.<br/><br/>The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, who becomes involved in organized crime at the age of twenty, after being forced into it by his father Don Vito Corleone to protect their family from a rival gang and corrupt police officers. Michael is put under."
3258,tt0068646,The Godfather,This movie is a great honor for all American cinema. Really It&#39;s nice an great I&#39;ve watched this movie 23 times (until now) and I am planing to watch it more. I would like to thank Marlon Brando and Al pacino for this and of course the great director &quot;Copola&quot;
628,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare movies that gets everything right. It&#39;s not flashy or loud, but it hits harder than most films ever could. The story of Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully imprisoned for murder, unfolds slowly and patiently, but never feels dull. Every scene matters, and every moment builds toward something that actually pays off.<br/><br/>Tim Robbins gives a quiet, steady performance that grows more powerful the longer the film goes. Morgan Freeman, as Red, is the heart of the movie. The chemistry between the two feels effortless. You believe this friendship because it&#39;s earned, not forced.<br/><br/>Some movies try to be profound by forcing big moments or dramatic twists. Shawshank earns it by just telling a great story, simply and honestly."
412,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"&quot;I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be.<br/><br/>We know how all that turned out .<br/><br/>Shawshank 10/10<br/><br/>Didn&#39;t do as well at the movies but wow on the dvd sales. And after this many years it still holds over. 9.0 on Imbd .... Impressive.<br/><br/>I wish there was little more substance for the ending , like where was Red going to live ?

Tim was with Susan S for over 20 years but never married . Dang that is something.<br/><br/>Get busy living ..."
5691,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Possibly my favorite movie, this is an unsurpassed gangster film and well deserving of the universal praise it received.  It scores a 10 in my book, not surprisingly, but I will include what I consider to be some minor flaws. First and foremost, the kindheartedness of Brando&#39;s Vito Corleone character is extremely misleading.  I don&#39;t believe that any mob boss of that era, or even today, possesses anything but heartless greed for money and power. The viewer is left thinking that Vito is warm and gentle and had no choice but to enter the life of crime to support his family--bulls**t! The sequel (another gem) tries to explain this, but I still don&#39;t buy it.  Also, I don&#39;t think James Caan was cast well as the hot-headed Sonny.  He looks about as Italian as James Cagney.  His acting is superb, but I think someone like Robert DeNiro (who also auditioned for the role!) would have delivered a far more accurate portrayal.  On that note, it also struck me that Richard Castellano, who plays Clemenza, could have just as convincingly played the Don as Marlon Brando and, perhaps, saved the producers millions. Brando is, of course, phenomenal, but I think it&#39;s important to point out that the less recognized co-stars are comparably as talented.  Aside from this, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece not to be missed."
1272,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Never saw that plot twist coming, shocking element always makes me watch more movies and this was one of the best among them with great build up and filled with emotions.<br/><br/>I would definitely give it a another watch someone who have same interest as me in movie or the day where i am feeling nostalgic about this movie or how i felt today.<br/><br/>I am rating it 1 but still don&#39;t think this was the greatest movie ever made of course it gives tough competition but for me definition of movie that should be called masterpiece is Shutter island, but i would still rate as legendary work that kept my attention across from start to end."
2243,tt0068646,The Godfather,At first i tough this movie will be a boring one. but after watching it ... it give me a gosebump... the storyline so good .. it makes me know how cruel the world back then
4737,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Excellent story, a perfect scenario. Great actors and director has made the movie a masterpiece. This is a film that does not leave you indifferent after watching. For a long time I had to force myself to watch this movie. I now regret that I did not saw it before because I didn&#39;t started in time to appreciate the Al Pacino acting and Francis Copolla work. And of course, it is needless to mention the excellent work of Marlon Brando. This movie makes you to fall in love with New York in the 1920s, and to wish that you were born in that time. This is one of those rare movies whose II and III part are not ruininig the whole story and the overall impression of the film. The second and third sequel even more complete story. In addition to the excellent story and acting, and you will enjoy the artistic dimension of this masterpiece."
3737,tt0068646,The Godfather,This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen that&#39;s all that I&#39;m gonna say.
2547,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get."
5331,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Another oddity in my collection, it is an overrated piece similar to &#39;Citizen Kane&#39; and &#39;Schindler&#39;s List&#39; although much more watchable I have to say. In the end there are too many ridiculous scenes and poor acting that undersells the overall arching plot.<br/><br/>Some strange things I have to ask within the first hour. Why does Don Corleone buy fruit in some craphole edge of the road stall? Why two oranges and a pepper? When the hitmen run towards him he does nothing to defend himself, yet he knows they are gunning for him. They shoot over 6 rounds into him and he, as an old man, survives and is placed into intrusive care?<br/><br/>What the hell writing is this? Or perhaps this is more a failing in direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Michael Corleone finds out his father was shot by walking around the street and finding a newspaper with something on it? What? Not a phone call or something that makes sense?<br/><br/>This is then followed by Sonny Corleone getting a phone call of the shooting. Why not Michael? What is going on there? Then Sonny writes a note with a pen on the kitchen cabinet door? What the hell? Not a piece of paper or just remember the facts, but he writes on the cabinet door?<br/><br/>This is awful. The script is nonsensical and the attention to irrelevant details is what boggles my mind. I think simple minded people think that is fascinating or something but it doesn&#39;t hold up the suspension of disbelief for me.<br/><br/>What I like from this film is the slow pace and burn. The conflict from the family turf war is gritty and well done. I love that David Chase, like many, took some inspiration from this movie and put a lot of details into &#39;The Sopranos&#39;. But this movie itself is above average, well made, but full of plot holes and useless tat that could have been cut down to a tight film. The movie &#39;Goodfellas&#39; has served more inspiration to filmmakers and popular culture than this title did.<br/><br/>Scenes such as the &quot;Leave the gun, take the cannoli&quot; one aren&#39;t as great as people claim. In this film it is just an afterthought that was captured on film. Nothing special in the way scenes like that were shot or presented, just bog average really.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is the transformation of Michael Corleone, it is good writing. But of course that came from the book, didn&#39;t it. This starts to get interesting at just before the hour mark. The murder scene is good but something is off about it. The wine cork pop is a joke, surely? The hit itself was well done, and showed at least how a hit should be done. But the bit of fanfare music is over the top and then a strange piano solo music to accompany the scenes thereafter? They use the garbage spinning newspaper montage like &#39;Citizen Kane&#39; did, and it is lazy in my opinion.<br/><br/>Then plot then send Micahel off to Italy, which is ridiculous. The about turn in tone is off putting and thereafter I always lose interest. Somehow he gets married to an Italian girl and then becomes boss so suddenly. This is bad writing and happens too fast. Don Corleone in Italy running around with a small child in the tomatoes was ridiculous and over the top; stomping through the tomatoes like Goddzilla, then dies.<br/><br/>The end 30 minutes with Michael running things is again, over the top and ridiculous. He spent his whole life in school and the military, he knows jack diddly about the family and now they show him running everything on his own.<br/><br/>Whatever people say is great about this film, I question with more thought. It is not awful but it is certainly not a masterpiece. For gangster movies I prefer &#39;Goodfellas&#39; and &#39;Casino&#39;, and of course &#39;The Sopranos&#39; is the best written title ever created.<br/><br/>7/10 a good movie though nonsensical at times with above average filming."
5359,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This film is excellent in every way possible. It contains superb acting, directing, writing and is an all round great film.<br/><br/>It includes family values, but in a violent and protective way. It is very thrilling, violent, informative and it moves at a good pace.<br/><br/>The film has many things, one of which is values. The Godfather balances everything crucial in a film. It is violent, but not an action; it is touching, but not a romance; it includes family values, but is not a family film; it includes all of these and becomes a crime/drama.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a must see. Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s masterpiece. Also see The Godfather: Part II, The Conversation, Apocalypse Now, The Godfather: Part III and of course, his final outstanding film effort, Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula."

2175,tt0068646,The Godfather,"And so I finally decided to watch the second highest rated movie of all time. I must have missed something here, because I found this glorified family drama talky insanely boring! Note, this review might contain spoilers. It&#39;s the only way for me to remember this dreary movie...<br/><br/>This 3-hour talk-fest depicts the lives of the Italian crime family Corleone. At least somewhere at the 40-minute mark and I think once later in the film, as well, there was gunfire to keep me awake. As for the rest of the movie, it felt like I was watching a few dozen episodes of a daily soap-opera. Yawn!<br/><br/>At the head of the family is Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). The film starts with the wedding of his daughter, Connie, to Carlo Rizzi. This wedding lasts the first 27 minutes of the movie. Here we meet the family. There&#39;s Don&#39;s sons Michael, Sonny and Fredo (who is an insignificant character who might as well not have been there), and Tom Hagen, whom the family took in when Sonny found him homeless wandering the streets. Michael&#39;s girlfriend is Kay, but when he flees later in the movie he marries another woman on impulse without giving Kay a second thought!!!!<br/><br/>The Corleones is a wealthy and powerful crime family. When drug lord Sollozzo approaches Don with a business proposition, Don declines. Later, Sollozzo has Don shot, and kidnaps Tom. So, Don Corleone is the film&#39;s lead character, but once he is shot around the 40-minute mark, he disappears for most of the movie...or, well, he is there, but bed-ridden and inactive. He doesn&#39;t even play a big part during the film&#39;s finale. I thought he was supposed to be the protagonist, but he takes a back seat for most of the movie. And why is he talking in that annoying whispering voice?<br/><br/>&#39;The Godfather&#39; is a very involved film with many characters to keep track of. In all honesty, I found the film dragging and boring. There&#39;s no defined goal. There&#39;s no defined protagonist. There&#39;s no defined antagonist.<br/><br/>There&#39;s no denying &#39;The Godfather&#39; is a well written, well made movie with superb performances from a stellar cast, but it doesn&#39;t even nearly rate among my favourite movies. The purpose of watching a movie, is to be entertained. Unfortunately, with &#39;The Godfather&#39; I wasn&#39;t. Even my partner yawned on several occasions asking me if this really was the second highest rated movie. I&#39;m sorry, this is not for me. Yawn, already, yawn! Maybe back in the 1972 it was special, but with so many (much better) movies out there, I found &#39;The Godfather&#39; forgettable..."
4334,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is without a doubt one of the all-time greats, and the acting performances of Marlin Brando as Vito Corleone and James Caan as Sonny match that comment (Al Pacino is also good, but they have the edge).  The first two-thirds of the movie is definitely better, but the last third does its job in finalizing Mike&#39;s evolution into a Mafia chief.<br/><br/>The movie adds to the mystique of Brando as Godfather by not having him the center of action except for the first third of the movie, keeping you from that overdone feeling, and his major decisions are made in the wedding and shortly thereafter.  But oh, the classic scenes that resulted:  the friendship scene with Bonasera, the &quot;making an offer that he can&#39;t refuse&quot; line, the horse&#39;s head, the hand stabbing/strangling death of Luca Brasi. In the minority situation for an actor&#39;s being made to look older than he is, Brando is superb.  The cotton stuffing in his mouth works magnificently. He is The Godfather all the way -- way, way over Michael.  His wisdom and counsel are greater, and his majesty; Michael is a morose figure.<br/><br/>Sonny is a formidable, memorable character (is he not much taller than James Caan is?), and his blatant id contrasts with Vito and Michael.  Tom Hagen is also played very well, by Robert Duvall, and other actors and actresses do a good job.  The hypocrisy crystallized by the Catholic mass setting is also excellent.  And hey, is not Sonny beating up his brother in law one of the very, very best fight scenes, even if one-sided?  What can I cite by comparison, Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris in The Way of the Dragon -- and yes, not sarcastically -- for what good fight scenes are so distinctive, intense and original, leaving such an imprint--what other very good fight scene also sticks out so much in one&#39;s mind over others?  You can&#39;t say, &quot;they&#39;re all the same&quot; for this one.  Sonny, like Vito and Mike, is part of American popular culture (well, I guess international, not to be chauvinistic).<br/><br/>One of my friends, and perhaps yours, has said, &quot;I was rooting for the Corleones.&quot;  As one who likes many thrillers, action and suspense movies, and crime dramas, but does not like the overly depressing subject matter and sleazy characters and sometimes tortuous, overcomplicated plots that characterize the mid-70s onward (Pulp Fiction, Grifters, etc.), I note that this is unfortunately a forerunner of these, altho not hard to follow.  But I think it was the Godfather Part II that really was the precursor, and II&#39;s quality pales in comparison to I&#39;s (I do not care what others think), and much more than other sequels.  Because the genius of The Godfather I was taking such sordid subject matter and making it so entertaining, so much a part of our consciousness, and leaving us with such positive feeling when we think about it.  I do not believe this is the case for many later movies to which its influence can be traced."

5605,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is absolutely the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen. Such drama, best actors ever and a story which make hamlet look like a school theater play! Godlike Marlon Brando as a Godfather in a mafia family, Perfect! And Al Pacino as his son! It can&#39;t be any better. you who haven&#39;t seen it, SEE IT!"
831,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"This film is exceptional.<br/><br/>In terms of reality it&#39;s nonsense but that shouldn&#39;t be a barrier.<br/><br/>Personally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worthy of being top on IMDB despite being a stunning film. There are other films that are better at fantasy, there are better films about crime and injustice set in reality.<br/><br/>However, there are few movies that are as emotionally moving as this if you have a soul of any kind and ignore the farcical nature of a prison system in the 1940s then the film is pretty, pretty good.<br/><br/>I was struggling as to whether five this film 10 stars or 4!! Wjich might seem off but after tons of viewing, i would still watch it again and again."

3753,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I really don&#39;t know how else to summarize the review of such a perfect movie.<br/><br/>&quot;The Godfather&quot; is undoubtedly my favorite legitimate, serious attempt at film-making. Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s brilliant direction enhances performances from such top-quality actors as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and more.<br/><br/>It is a violent, tense masterpiece, a movie in the small pantheon with &quot;Alexander&quot; and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (as well as the remainder of its own trilogy) that can hold your attention for three or more hours and never skew boring. If you&#39;re still unsure, pay attention to the squibs. Or the brilliantly natural production design. Or Gordon Willis&#39;s imaginative cinematography.<br/><br/>Still not convinced? Just listen to this: it&#39;s much better than the book. &quot;The Godfather,&quot; while very brutal, is probably the greatest American cinematic masterpiece. And if you won&#39;t believe this reviewer, believe the people who exalted this film to a 9.1, making it the IMDb&#39;s highest-rated film. It is one of few movies on the Top 250 that deserves such a position."
3787,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is a visual epic with grand performances from the entire cast. Marlon Brando&#39;s &quot;Banana Mouth Trick&quot; is one of the most imitated characters in movie history.<br/><br/> Also, its stars Robert DuVall, James Caan and Al Pacino in oscar winning roles. Francis Ford Coppola directs, with relative Sofia putting in an uncredited performance.<br/><br/> The acting is solid, the story is brilliant, and the direction is superb.<br/><br/> Although this is true, I actually preferred the second sequel. This is probably because of Andy Garcia&#39;s incredible performance as Vinnie Corleone.<br/><br/> The Godfather Trilogy is Hollywood&#39;s greatest films. Do not miss any of them. They are true gems. Rating=4/5"
4291,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a 1972 masterpiece. It is based on Mario Puzo&#39;s novel of the same name, and stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The story of the movie takes place from 1945 to 1955. It the best movie about the Mafia. In addition, many have called it the best movie of all time. A sequel, The Godfather Part II, was released in 1974 and won another Best Picture Oscar, too. It was the only sequel to do so until 2003&#39;s The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The third movie in the Godfather trilogy, The Godfather Part III, came out in 1990. I think it was not as good as the other two movies. Even though if we think the trilogy as one movie, it is the greatest work of the seventh art, I think."
1569,tt0068646,The Godfather,My think The Godfather is the best movie in the world because all the actors is very good at this.Actually I really happy for that and we will do better this film.I belive this.End of the is vey sadness.It happens every time.All the main characters died end of the film.
680,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don&#39;t feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.<br/><br/>It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn&#39;t need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn&#39;t win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don&#39;t let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb&#39;s top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.<br/><br/>Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."

268,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne&#39;s (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.<br/><br/>However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it&#39;s only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don&#39;t think it&#39;s entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.<br/><br/>But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>9/10"
4133,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the &quot;greatest films of all time&quot;. Even though I&#39;ve given it a 10, I wouldn&#39;t put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I&#39;ve given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it&#39;s only because it&#39;s so highly regarded--if you&#39;ve not experienced the film yet. I think it&#39;s a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.<br/><br/>Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap- operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you&#39;ve watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, &quot;Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?&quot; The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film&#39;s appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.<br/><br/>But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather&#39;s brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi&#39;s violence is effective, setting that knob to &quot;11&quot; doesn&#39;t make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl."
2604,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo&#39;s novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it&#39;s still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today&#39;s standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.<br/><br/>I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is &#39;The Godfather&#39;. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes."
2512,tt0068646,The Godfather,A work of art that will always remain on the list of the greatest of all time. I was a kid when I first watched it. I&#39;ve watched it dozens of times. It fascinates with its details every time I watch it.
3303,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is excellent! Probably the best I&#39;ve ever seen the props are very good minding the year it was released and the acting is out of this world. I&#39;ve read the book before and after watching the movie and I tell you the second time was much better! It was like the pictures the book tried to create came out alive as I&#39;ve seen the in the movie and it was really cool. They did put a lot of effort to this movie and it does pay off, as the scenery and the costumes and everything is so detailed. Of course the atmosphere of the movie is marvelous and really travels you back to the 40s spot on! You should totally see this movie, or better watch the whole trilogy. It is must!"
2098,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Defining the greatest movie of all time is a subjective endeavor, as cinematic tastes vary widely among audiences. However, there are certain films that have transcended generations, cultures, and critical acclaim to earn the title of cinematic masterpieces. Among these, one film consistently stands out as a timeless classic: &quot;The Godfather.&quot;<br/><br/>Released in 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a cinematic tour de force that has left an indelible mark on the landscape of filmmaking. Adapted from Mario Puzo&#39;s bestselling novel of the same name, the film transports viewers into the intricate world of the Italian-American mafia, exploring themes of power, family, loyalty, and betrayal with unparalleled depth and complexity.<br/><br/>At the heart of &quot;The Godfather&quot; lies the compelling story of the Corleone crime family, led by the enigmatic patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, portrayed with mesmerizing gravitas by Marlon Brando. Brando&#39;s performance as the Don is nothing short of iconic, capturing the character&#39;s blend of charisma, cunning, and vulnerability with remarkable nuance. Through his portrayal, Brando humanizes a figure often depicted as a ruthless mob boss, inviting viewers to empathize with the complexities of his character&#39;s moral ambiguity."
2265,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I am never ever seen an acter or actress better than marlon brando can handle a roll play . any one want to be anything in cinema must see godfather for at least 10 times to learn how to right,produc, sdreen right and .... othet"
2776,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, is not just a movie; it&#39;s a cinematic masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on American film history. With its compelling storytelling, brilliant acting, and impeccable direction, The Godfather stands as one of the greatest movies ever made.<br/><br/>At its core, The Godfather is a story of power, family, and the American dream. The film unfolds in the backdrop of a fictionalized Italian-American crime family led by Don Vito Corleone, played masterfully by Marlon Brando. From the very beginning, we are immersed in the world of the Corleones, where loyalty, honor, and respect are the cornerstones of their empire. Brando&#39;s portrayal of the patriarch is nothing short of legendary, and he brings an aura of gravitas to his character. His subtle gestures, the way he speaks, and his sheer presence are awe-inspiring. Brando&#39;s performance earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor, and it&#39;s a testament to his prowess as an actor.<br/><br/>In addition to Brando, the film boasts a stellar ensemble cast that includes Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. Pacino, in particular, delivers a performance that marked the beginning of his illustrious career. As Michael Corleone, he undergoes a remarkable transformation from a war hero who initially wants no part in the family&#39;s criminal enterprises to a ruthless, calculating mob boss. It&#39;s a character arc that Pacino handles with finesse and subtlety, making Michael one of the most iconic figures in cinematic history.<br/><br/>The Godfather&#39;s storytelling is a work of art in itself. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, who authored the original novel, is a study in character development and plot intricacy. The film is a compelling exploration of the consequences of choices and the burden of power. It draws viewers into a world of intrigue, betrayal, and moral ambiguity, as the Corleones navigate a treacherous path to maintain their empire. Every scene, every line of dialogue, and every plot twist is meticulously crafted, making it a story that remains gripping from start to finish.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s direction by Francis Ford Coppola is nothing short of brilliant. He carefully balances moments of intense drama with quieter, more reflective scenes. The use of shadows and lighting is particularly noteworthy, creating an atmosphere of tension and foreboding. The wedding sequence that opens the film is a perfect example of Coppola&#39;s directorial mastery, setting the stage for the unfolding drama. The Godfather is a visual and auditory treat, thanks to Gordon Willis&#39; cinematography and Nino Rota&#39;s hauntingly beautiful musical score.<br/><br/>The Godfather also excels in its portrayal of the immigrant experience in America. The Corleone family, like many real-life immigrant families, came to the United States seeking a better life. They worked hard, upheld their traditions, and eventually built an empire. The film explores the tension between the family&#39;s Italian roots and the American dream, a theme that resonates deeply with many viewers.<br/><br/>The Godfather&#39;s impact on popular culture is immeasurable. Phrases like &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot; and the horse head in the bed have become iconic moments in cinematic history. The film has been referenced, parodied, and paid homage to in countless movies and TV shows. Its influence is evident in the countless gangster films that followed, and it set the standard for what a crime drama could be.<br/><br/>While The Godfather is celebrated for its many strengths, it&#39;s also been criticized for its portrayal of women. Female characters in the film are often marginalized and exist primarily in relation to the male characters. This aspect has sparked important discussions about gender roles in cinema. Nevertheless, it&#39;s essential to view the film in the context of its time, recognizing the progress made in depicting women in more nuanced roles in contemporary cinema.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Godfather is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate audiences over 50 years after its release. It&#39;s a film that explores themes of power, family, and the American dream with depth and complexity. The performances, direction, and storytelling are all exemplary, making it a timeless masterpiece. The Godfather&#39;s influence on filmmaking is immeasurable, and its place in the pantheon of American cinema is secure. If you haven&#39;t experienced this classic, it&#39;s a must-watch for any lover of film, and for those who have, it&#39;s always worth revisiting this cinematic gem."
2925,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather has become over the years a classic and many consider it to be one of the best films ever made, this is truly deserved. Everything about the film is perfect and I simply cant think of anything that shouldn&#39;t be there as every single thing screams perfection. The performances by everyone are absolutely magnificent and possibly the best ensemble cast performance of all time, the actors live in their roles and do everything is done perfectly down to the last little detail, the screenplay and storyline are magnificent as the story evolves you get a engrossed in it and every second is epic, all the themes are well presented and the acting just makes everything stronger, I wasn&#39;t bored for a second. The music (original and not) is perfect and goes with the film and every time you hear it it reminds you of the film and the characters. This film is just the first out of three in the great Corleone saga but although i award the other two a 10/10 this one is the best in my opinion simply because it has so many memorable cinematic scenes that are some of the best in history but the other two films complete this one and add more to the story. All that said this movie should not be missed and anyone who enjoys cinema needs to check this out and then follow the rest of the story with the others. A true classic. 10/10"
3377,tt0068646,The Godfather,One of the most amazing Movies in the history. Very close to the original source and masterfully done. I believe everyone should check out this masterpiece.
191,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"&#39;The Shawshank Redemption&#39;... hmm where do I start. &#39;The Shawshank Redemption&#39; is clearly one of the greatest films ever, I find that it really can show what it would be like trapped in a tiny little prison, eventually you would only think of what&#39;s outside the prison instead of inside or you might even become attached to the prison or should I say home.<br/><br/>What the audience really enjoy&#39;s about this movie is that you have been deceived for you believe through out most of the movie that there is noway out for poor Andy Dufresne and that he is trying to be nice to the guards for a chance of believable. After that you discover that the whole film and everything that has happened has all gone towards the escape of Andy Dufresne and the suicide of the dreadful warden. The audience has been gullible enough to believe that Andy was getting used to the prison. <br/><br/>&#39;The Shawshank Redemption&#39; is clearly not just a movie, it is also beautiful art. Every little piece of the movie was delicately put together to create pure yet daunting art.<br/><br/>The story is about Andy Dufresne a wealthy intelligent banker who&#39;s wife is having an affair with another man. Eventually both the wife and the other man are killed while having sex, with all evidence pointing to Andy, Andy is sentenced to two life times of prison. In prison Andy does a lot of the workers at the prison&#39;s (and that include&#39;s the warden) banking. From then of the story is all about Andy in the prison and he idea&#39;s of hope and love of music.<br/><br/>One of the most beautiful and touching moments in the movie is when Andy locks all the doors in the room that has the microphone and plays opera music of two Italian women singing opera in Italian. Morgen Freeman then say&#39;s that he had no idea what the two Italian women were singing but doesn&#39;t want to know, he just like to imagine that the words were too beautiful to be sung in English.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant and the directing is directed absolutely unbelievably tremendous. I praise both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins for a very touching movie that I will always remember.<br/><br/>In conclusion, &#39;The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever that I have ever seen, if you do not like it I will also understand that you didn&#39;t listen closer to the brilliant word that were able to come out of the actors mouth.<br/><br/>Hope is a dangerous thing."
4348,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Where do I start, I shall start with the script. First of all it is flawless. Vito Corleone is being forced to start dealing in drugs from another family. He decides drugs is a dirty business. Then he finds out it&#39;s a bad idea because he gets shot... don&#39;t worry he didn&#39;t die.. not yet anyway. Michael his son decides to take care of him while he is the hospital..this in turn leads Michael to decide he wants to be part of the family business. He gets a sucker punch from a crooked cop. That leads to him being mad so the family want revenge. He meets them at a restaurant and for those of you who have seen the film.. you know what happens. Anyway Michael goes into hiding in Italy.. he then comes back years later and marries his old sweat heart Kay. He is now the boss of the family.<br/><br/>That tells you a lot about the plot but I think it is necessary to let you know what you are in for if you want to know about this film. I will now tell you about the cinematography it is gorgeous views on location in Italy out in the country.. also the look in new york all dark and sinister is great feel for the film.. I also love when they go to Las Vegas near the end and Michael wants to get a gaming license in Nevada. This is historically accurate in a sense that the mob made Las Vegas what you see today (the vision came from Bugsy Siegel.Now the music is the most amazing score I have ever come across in my life.. it is just fantastic.. You just have to watch the film to experience to this whole arc of family, loyalty and greed is one of the best portraits of the mafia you will ever see. <br/><br/>In all this is a great film about family and how you can&#39;t get out of anything you love.. because once your in the mob there is no way out except you know what <br/><br/>I love this film I rank it number 3 on my all time list.. and I just love it.. In fact I might go and watch it right now"
4409,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is said to be the number one movie of all time on here, IMDb&#39;s top 250 movies of all time.<br/><br/>I disagree. In my humble opinion that spot is reserved for Citizen Kain, Casablanca, or perhaps even Akira Kurosawa&#39;s classic, The Seven Samurai.<br/><br/>With that said, this movie is an excellent film. This movie shows us the intricacies of the mafia. Instead of being a film about the mafia concerned with killing and drug dealing and such, we see the family waiting for the next hit or planning a deal or whatever it may be. It is a movie about family and what happens on the inside of the mafia.<br/><br/>The film draws you in and makes you feel as if you are part of the family. Al Pacino is incredible and his character arc is done so well, I don&#39;t know if anyone else could have pulled it off. Marlon Brando is great as Don Vito Corleone.<br/><br/>This is an amazing film. I give it a 10 out of 10. A must see. But again, I don&#39;t agree that it is the number one film of all time. Everyone has their opinion though."
4633,tt0068646,The Godfather,This is a piece of art. For me it is after The Shawshank Redemption the best movie of alltime. It&#39;s just incredible story telling. You never get bored and it&#39;s even in 2022 still just factual a good mafia movie. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are playing magnificent. The music in connection with the movie is just perfect. The whole part in Sicily is realistic and well done. I love that all the people speak italian there. The film is a brand new thing on his own. After the moral code is broken. The whole storyline his full of small side storys. Every side story is good on his own. I just watch this film again every year and it&#39;s never boring.
2279,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It&#39;s considered a classic because it was cynically designed to be a classic; it knows the the secrets of tension and payoff, it hooks the idiots with some random moaning broad getting boned in the first few minutes, and enough money was pumped into it that it looks like a painting in motion. You got tits and glamourized gangster machismo for the men, and scenic rural Italy for the women.<br/><br/>It would be obvious how paper-thin and sadly calculated it all really is if the performances didn&#39;t propel it into something approaching three- dimensionality. I think I prefer Goodfellas because it deconstructs everything this movie is, and is a much more natural, interesting movie in the process."
2785,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is the greatest movie ever made, I&#39;m not joking. I have watched a lot of movies, movies with more oscars and not a single one is better than this. The story, the casting, even the soundtrack is perfect."
4721,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The scriptwriter and the performance of the magic of the numerous strokes, can be found in &quot;The Godfather&quot; to the audience &quot;big screen&quot; experience is enough to refute those who oppose."
3407,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This was the first mafia story I saw. After watching this one, I saw other similar movies which a follow a group of mafia/criminals usually in a New York City setting, but this one still remains as my favorite. The actors are top notch, and the story is brilliant. Now, kiss my left and right cheek!"
4260,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Not often you will be able to find a film that is as good as the novel it&#39;s based upon. For sure the reason in this case is that Mario Puzo also wrote the screenplay. Fully recommended to read the book and to watch the film, in either order. Any more comment needless."
2989,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Overrated movie that romanticizes the mafia. Script is average, the performances and scenography are good, but they don&#39;t wash away the weak script. Don Vito Corleone is just a romanticized and unbelievable mob boss."
4467,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Excellent adult move. Love the music. I could have watched this all day long. Perfect length, if anything too short. Marlon Brando really defines the role of an Italian mafioso patriarch. I permanently learned the phrase, &quot;make them an offer they can&#39;t refuse.&quot; Al Pacino gives another brilliant performance as the son who get drawn into his father&#39;s business, bit by bit. Then, Al Pacino becomes his father to continue his work. Al Pacino&#39;s character becomes even more ruthless a godfather than Marlon Brando. Robert Duvall, the family lawyer, gives a brilliant performance as one who at first comes off like a lamb but is really a lion in disguise. Diane Keaton plays a predictable character but gives an OK performance. The musical score is memorable. Just thinking about the movie brings to mind the musical score second to the character, the Godfather played by Marlon Brando. So powerful!"
3960,tt0068646,The Godfather,I watched it 2 times and still dont see why people are so obsessed with this movie. There&#39;s nothing extraordinary about this film.
3080,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I have seen many many movies and this is simply one of the best. My 2nd favorite film of all time. If you havent seen this film, get up and go to your local blockbuster. Forget that, just go buy it since you&#39;ll want to view it many many times. Be sure to get The Godfather Part II while you&#39;re there."
5594,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I&#39;m not going to waste my time and my words on the plot or the summary of the film, but I&#39;ll write about the feelings that I proved watching &quot;the Godfather&quot;. This film is a perfect movie and the cast is one of the best ever seen: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire... The majority of the actors are still appreciated and sought-after. The cinematography is wonderful; the soundtrack is very good (when I hear the trumpet at the real beginning I have the creep). I was really surprised when I read that &quot;the Godfather&quot; won only three Academy Awards: it should have won at least 10 of them. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is one of of the films that will be remembered even many years by now, and it&#39;s without doubts one of my favourite movies (with &quot;the Godfather - part II and part III&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot;). Don&#39;t miss it!"
3190,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Long and boring and not worth writing two sentences. But since I have to, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, I think you get my point!"
4457,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Hmmmm... well... I spent some time thinking about what I would write about this movie. First off, I am very disappointed I can´t give this movie a 11. Because you see... it is that good. It is nothing more and nothing less than perfection- if they cut a part of the moive, I would miss it. If they add anything to it, I would discard it. Acting is top-notch. Direction cannot receive comments enough to describe how good it is. The story is one of the best ever. I mean... what more could anyone want?<br/><br/>I am very sad a lot of people that voted for American Beauty made it look like as good as this one. I mean... we cannot compare both movies, can we? If this one drops one rank because of pityful American Beauty, i will be very sad. And I just can imagine anyone giving this one a 1. 7 at least. Not 1 or 2 or 3. People who give ratings like this to a movie such as The Godfaher must only like unimaginative amateur movies such as American Beauty. Sorry I am talking about another movie, but I just can´t imagine The Godfather loosing one rank to American Beauty."
5274,tt0068646,The Godfather,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. I love and watch every month at least once.<br/><br/>Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects....."
1802,tt0068646,The Godfather,One of the greatest sagas of all time!! I&#39;ve watched every single minute. The depth that writer takes is not easily written and the actors brings it to life with absolute brilliance.
1518,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release, and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times, and those 178 minutes still fly by.<br/><br/>Some movies are designed for entertainment, whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.<br/><br/>Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling, and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.<br/><br/>It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history, and it&#39;s hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also, the shots of Diane Keaton place her character, Kay, outside of the &#39;family&#39; in numerous situations. The famous &#39;Baptism of Fire&#39; sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years, but cannot help doing so.<br/><br/>The 1970s were another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking, and The Godfather was one of the best examples."
4104,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I have been watching movies since last 35 years but have never been drawn more to a movie that can influece you to make your own film. Thats what made me a film maker to be honest. Reading Mario Puzos Godfather and seeing how it translated onto the silver screen told me how the writer in me could become the person who can visualize.<br/><br/>Cinematography, Editing, Direction, Acting and all the other Crafts that make it a 24 craft game are explained in this movie as to why you need all 24 crafts to be perfect. To make a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Godfather has been adapted by thousands or filmmakers which made a few great and a few legends, but there is no movie like the GodFather. Storaro at his very best, Brando at his prime, Al pacino in his element brought it all for the Director and the studio make their dream come true. One of those very rare must watch classics."
3073,tt0068646,The Godfather,I think if you want to learn story board of drama movie you must see this film.and break down the shots - its awesome movie for watching - the lighting is weak.
2629,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb&#39;s Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont&#39;s emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can&#39;t be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren&#39;t showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).<br/><br/>In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza&#39;s bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way<br/><br/>The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.<br/><br/>Coppola&#39;s storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank&#39;s plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.<br/><br/>Nino Rota&#39;s score for Coppola&#39;s movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can&#39;t even recall Shawshank&#39;s score.<br/><br/>Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn&#39;t sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that&#39;s Italian for &#39;perfect&#39;. Possibly).<br/><br/>In short, The Godfather is the don in every department."
1500,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&#39;The Godfather&#39; is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse&#39;s severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It&#39;s one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I&#39;ve seen much better films that &#39;The Godfather&#39;, and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film."

His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father&#39;s business. Through Michael&#39;s life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family.

Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don&#39;s lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.<br/><br/>-TheElfstone."
3673,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie was amazing. I&#39;ve always wanted to watch it and I thought it wasn&#39;t my kind of movie at first since I&#39;m more of a romance or thriller kind of person, but I was so wrong. It catches your attention from the beginning till the end. It surprised me, made me smile and also made me feel sad. The performances made by all the actors were amazing, the cinematography was outstanding as well but most importantly the writing, pacing and music were all magnificent, clever and carefully studied to make this movie stand out. I am italian so maybe this is a reason I enjoyed it even more, especially in the parts in which they talked italian, though I&#39;m not from Sicily so sometimes I didn&#39;t get the dialect.. finally, this movie made me fall in love with Al Pacino and Marlon Brando&#39;s acting skills. It gives you everything and relaxes you while keeping you entertained, so that 3 hours will easily go by. Thank you! I&#39;ll definetely watch the other 2 movies."
4543,tt0068646,The Godfather,"God father is the movie of definition for Gangster stories! <br/><br/>It doesn&#39;t matter What business you are involving, but Every man has to take care of his family at all times. There should be principle in your business and don&#39;t ever violate the limits which you set up. Let your actions speak for you. Like Godfather, Give them offers that the cant refuse!!<br/><br/>I can feel the background music still when i am remember this film. Wonderful background score and almost all the characters were well played by the artists. What negative i could say is the length of the film. When i finish watching the film, its kind of feeling that i have lived in Sicily, America and all the locations the films was traveling.. I am a fan of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino after watching this movie.<br/><br/>Overall The Godfather is not only a Movie but Its an Experience!! DO watch it and feel it!!"
4097,tt0068646,The Godfather,"just outstanding the sense or morality even thought what they do is wrong, you get a sense of pride and respect. at the end you do start wanting to create the same level of respect and love with your own family as if it was the same. defiantly deserves the word legendary as it is a timeless classic and should be watched if you haven&#39;t already.<br/><br/>this movie should be watched closely and with patients to get into as i can come across so the viewers that are not use to this type of pace, storyline can get confusing sometimes if your bad with names, other than that there no issues the film is well known for a reason and allows for multiple deductions to made within it as you try to find out who did what."
3294,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather follows the Corleone crime family as they enter into a dispute between the 5 families.<br/><br/>This movie is insanely well crafted and when you pair that with a phenomenal cast you get what many consider to be the greatest film ever made.<br/><br/>There are really two key stories taking place in this film. First we see the development of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino, his character is given a great arc in the film and you really get to see the impact that the life of crime has on a person. The second key story is essentially the rest of the Corleone family. Sure we get certain subplots involving different members of the family, but it all is really used to show this life of crime.<br/><br/>If you are someone that has been raised on fast paced blockbusters I suggest you steer clear of this film because you will find it very slow. But if you are someone that loves movies that dive into and explore a character and certain themes, this film is for you. The film does a phenomenal job of having a really straightforward story. We first get introduced to the characters and get a good sense of what makes them tick. As the story progresses it sets up different plot points and conflicts that leave you guessing what exactly is going to happen. These plot points and conflicts are constantly being developed and resolved throughout the film, and when you get to the end it leaves you with a very satisfying conclusion that wraps everything up perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall this is a phenomenal film. The amazing construction of the story paired with an insanely talented cast will please any movie lover.<br/><br/>10/10."
3767,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The first thing i have to say is that it&#39;s way too long and you can barely get through it, part of this is because there are too many extended scenes in it. Granted it&#39;s a good movie, but not by any chance the best movie ever made and not better than The Shawshank Redemption (i&#39;m comparing it to Shawshank because they are the 2 leading movies in the IMDb top). The acting is great, the script is good and the directing is OK, but that doesn&#39;t make it the best movie ever made. There&#39;s almost no foreshadowing in it, there are no major twists in the plot thus making the storyline actually a straight line and there&#39;s nothing in the movie that surprises you. When i watched it i was at the edge of boredom and was hoping something would show up in that movie that would pull me back. It&#39;s true that it was a very daring movie at the time, but still that alone doesn&#39;t make a movie great."
4140,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I don&#39;t think this movie deserves 9.2. It is a boring family drama movie, no doubt the actors were one of the best but overall the movie is super bore and normal crime/drama movie. But again I&#39;ll say the cast was superb.
Just see shawshank redemption, it&#39;s a masterpiece and godfather just doesn&#39;t deserve to be so close to shawshank"
234,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The first time I saw &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank &quot;Shawshank&quot; as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film, you must (in the words of Andy), &quot;Get busy livin&#39;, or get busy dyin&#39;.&quot;"

Everything from the story, themes, and character development to the cinematography, editing, and soundtrack is masterfully done.<br/><br/>Andy and Red&#39;s character arcs, along with the overarching theme of hope, have always stood out to me.

2602,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;The Godfather&quot; is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema...<br/><br/>His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal &quot;families,&quot; and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times... <br/><br/>With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse&quot; has reached legendary statues... Brando&#39;s Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime...<br/><br/>While crime may be the first image that comes into one&#39;s mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by &quot;liquor, gambling, and even women...&quot; He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the &quot;sovereignty.&quot; In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly...<br/><br/>The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability...<br/><br/>Pacino&#39;s gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment &quot;Never to take sides against the Family.&quot; <br/><br/>The opening shot of &quot;The Godfather&quot; sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...<br/><br/>Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:<br/><br/>Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can&#39;t seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie&#39;s most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie &quot;big shot&quot; named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone&#39;s most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael&#39;s safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer...<br/><br/>With a beautiful score by Nino Rota immensely memorable, Coppola&#39;s motion picture remains a triumph, nearly perfect in its execution, composition, and impact..."
2741,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I thought the book was overdone and corny when I read it in 71; and I thought the movie was overacted and bordered on fantasy when I saw it in 72.<br/><br/>Having spent 22 years in a major city&#39;s police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.<br/><br/>There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron."
437,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,I saw it a lot of times and I am ready to watch it again everytime. Great actors playing extremly fitting roles and a great story make this movie a go to movie for everyone.
2857,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It is amazing to see such quality of actors all in one film.  Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pacino, and John Cazale fill out one of the more impressive casts seen in modern movie making. You can just feel the intensity of the whole chain of events that happen."
458,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Belonging to the younger generation, I often wondered what all the fuss about this movie was all about. I am a big fan of action movies, I normally do not watch movies that have a slow storyline. Inception , I always thought, was my favourite. Then I one day decided to watch the Shawshank Redemption. I was moved to the core of my heart. The movie instantly became my all-time favourite. It proved to me that, no matter how dark the tunnel may seem, there is always a light burning at the end of it. Its never too late to give up on hope. It keeps you burning bright, in spite of the incessant and seemingly undeserved storms all around you, till the time life may finally turn around for you. For if your light is not burning till then, you will never make it to that moment. This is what this movie has taught me. If you are feeling down about anything in your life, this is the movie you always wanted to watch."
775,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The cast is superb. A real chemistry seems to bond Robbins, Freeman, and their inner circle. Will Sadler, the stone-faced bad guy in Die Hard 2, steals several scenes as the country-loving Heywood, and Vancouver native Gil Bellows shines as Tommy, the cocky high-school drop-out whose fate is pretty much sealed once we&#39;re told he has a wife and baby son waiting for him outside the prison walls. Brown, with his hair trimmed so neatly he&#39;s this close to being a dead ringer for Al Gore, displays an obsessive brutality that his Highlander role never hinted at. Freeman delivers a subtle but potent performance, letting just the teeniest dabs of despair leak through the cracks of his easy- going facade. Robbins brings the perfect mixture of fresh-faced bewilderment and canny deceit to his role as Dufresne, handling the dramatic and comic elements with equal ease. Watching these actors work together is a real treat, and they more than make up for the script&#39;s deficiencies."
3923,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is as close to perfection as cinema will ever get in my opinion. I seriously doubt that I will ever watch a movie I love more than this one, Marlon Brando brings his quintessential performance as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino makes Micheals transformation from honorable war hero to ruthless mafia boss haunting and real. Every other actor is perfectly cast as well but those are just the standouts. The cinematography is simply stunning, inventive and revolutionized the way people shot movies. Every single moment in this movie is iconic and the dialouge is simply amazing, the climax is haunting as well. The Godfather is a timeless tradgey of corruption, I could write a novel on it but to put it into one sentence, the reason this movie is so great is because it does not fail in any aspect: the actors , cinematography, story, dialogue, characters, are all outstanding. The Godfather is a film that delivers in every department."
1412,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn&#39;t commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years."
19,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"It is a timeless tale of hope and resilience that remains deeply impactful to this day. Set within the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film intricately weaves a narrative of human spirit&#39;s triumph over adversity and the enduring power of hope. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver captivating performances, infusing life into their characters and making their journey truly unforgettable. Under the skilled direction of Frank Darabont, the film&#39;s storytelling unfolds seamlessly, drawing the audience into a world of despair and redemption. Through its exploration of friendship, injustice, and the pursuit of freedom, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; resonates with audiences worldwide, leaving a profound and emotional impression that lingers long after the credits roll."
2820,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Let me just start by saying that I am 50% Italian. I have nothing against Mafia movies. In fact, I have nothing against ANY type of movie. But, to say that this is the best movie of all time is simply insane.<br/><br/>
I saw absolutely nothing special. I kind of enjoyed the performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and James Caan... but besides that, there is not one really exceptional feature in sight. And the fact that it is one hour too long only brought down my enjoyment. It&#39;s not the worst film of all time... but not the best either."
1532,tt0068646,The Godfather,"One thing that&#39;s a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather&#39; is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.<br/><br/>
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there&#39;s really nothing in this movie that you couldn&#39;t get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.<br/><br/>What&#39;s best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.<br/><br/>
What&#39;s not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn&#39;t really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.<br/><br/>And that, at heart, is my problem. I&#39;ve seen the movie and I&#39;ve read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike&#39;s hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).<br/><br/>So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn&#39;t very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. The acting wasn&#39;t as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather&#39; is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.<br/><br/>8/10"

1514,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn&#39;t make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo&#39;s The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original &quot;Movie Brats&quot; who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film&#39;s screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): &quot;I&#39;m gonna make him an offer he can&#39;t refuse.&quot; I love this film to death! Marlon Brando&#39;s performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando&#39;s the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!! <br/><br/>The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan&#39;s rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone&#39;s family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo&#39;s best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures) <br/><br/>The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael&#39;s Sister and Vito&#39;s daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!<br/><br/>10/10 Grade: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Paramount Pictures Starring: Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall,Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte,Diane Keaton Director: Francis Ford Coppola Producer: Albert S.

2326,tt0068646,The Godfather,"At the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando&#39;s unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles.<br/><br/>Coppola&#39;s direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the &quot;Prince of Darkness,&quot; enhances the film&#39;s iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota&#39;s haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend.<br/><br/>A fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history."
1674,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is over done and over rated. It sucks.<br/><br/> It just doesn&#39;t make any sense why people like one crime film so much. There are so many good motion pictures out there, and out of all of them, people pick this one? Honestly Francis Ford Coppola is over rated, and he makes lots of trash films."
2852,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I&#39;ve seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it&#39;s too long but I think that&#39;s sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don&#39;t like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.<br/><br/>I give The Godfather a perfect: <br/><br/>5/5 or 10/10"

The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie Welland. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.<br/><br/>Nolan has made his &quot;I will always be remembered&quot; movie, this is the crown jewel in his portfolio.

He has three sons and the youngest son, Michel lives honestly with no connection with gangster&#39;s business. One day, Don gets hurt by the other crime family that against him. And Michel decides to retaliation. <br/><br/>This story is far from my real life but I was very interested in it. I felt parental love from that Don want Michel to live not like him. Don is a great person and that is reason why he becomes Don. I think Michel does not have to fight against the men. But if I were him, I am sure to do same. This film is apparently full of violence but indeed full of humanity, emotion and love. I recommend you to watch it if you want to think about your human nature. You must be able to learn a lot from Don Corleone."
4319,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Simply put, this is a very poor movie.  The acting was substandard... Marlon Brando stuffs his cheeks, giving himself a speech impediment which is almost unavoidable and does not make for an amazing performance, and Al Pacino walks around with a blank, emotionless face throughout the entire movie (which is the point at some times, but not the whole time).  Diane Keaton also plays easily one of the most annoying roles I have ever seen in a film. Every scene in this film drags on and on and on, making it very possible to summarize the whole thing without leaving out details in around thirty seconds.  The closest explanation I&#39;ve gotten from anyone I&#39;ve talked with in person about why this film is so great to them is because &quot;it&#39;s the Godfather.&quot;<br/><br/>A movie that puts you to sleep and is not exciting or interesting does not belong as the greatest movie of all time to me."
1618,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is an excellent movie. It has great actors great scenes and a great storyline. There is only one complaint that I have about it, a lot of the material covered in the book is not in the movie. Without giving away too much of the story there are many &quot;books&quot;(more like parts to the book) of the Godfather novel, such as the book II( focusing on Johnny Fontaine). Other than the exclusion of some parts that aren&#39;t focus on the main characters this is an extremely close adaptation of the novel( word for word in many sense epically near the begging of the movie). Al Pachino is at the top in this movie and steals the show, Brando is great also and Robert Duvol as Tom Hagen was wonderful.This is one of the best movies ever made."
5463,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s The Godfather is not just a movie; it&#39;s an experience. Released in 1972, it&#39;s become synonymous with cinematic brilliance, captivating audiences for generations with its operatic story of family, loyalty, and the corrosive nature of power.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando delivers a legendary performance as Don Vito Corleone, the aging patriarch of a New York mafia clan. Brando&#39;s take on the character is iconic - a mix of quiet menace and surprising tenderness, his raspy voice and deliberate silences speaking volumes.<br/><br/>The film follows the Corleones as they navigate the treacherous world of organized crime, facing betrayal, violence, and the ever-present threat of law enforcement. Coppola masterfully weaves a complex tapestry of characters, each with their own motivations and demons. Al Pacino shines as Michael, the reluctant heir to the Corleone empire, whose transformation from war hero to ruthless consigliere is both chilling and tragic.<br/><br/>Beyond the stellar performances, The Godfather is a technical marvel. Nino Rota&#39;s haunting score perfectly complements the film&#39;s melancholic tone, while Gordon Willis&#39;s cinematography bathes every scene in a rich, golden glow. The editing is masterful, maintaining a steady pace even as the film&#39;s three-hour runtime unfolds.<br/><br/>But what truly elevates The Godfather to its legendary status is its exploration of morality. The film doesn&#39;t shy away from the ugliness of the Corleones&#39; world, but it also forces us to confront the complexities of human nature. Are the Corleones simply villains, or are they tragic figures caught in a cycle of violence they can&#39;t escape?<br/><br/>Coppola doesn&#39;t provide easy answers. He leaves it to the audience to grapple with the moral ambiguities of the film, making The Godfather a cinematic experience that stays with you long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>Here are some of the film&#39;s strengths:<br/><br/>Stellar performances: Brando and Pacino deliver career-defining performances, while the supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, is equally impressive.<br/><br/>Gripping story: The film&#39;s complex plot keeps you guessing until the very end.<br/><br/>Masterful direction: Coppola&#39;s direction is assured and meticulous, creating a visually stunning and emotionally resonant film.<br/><br/>Thought-provoking themes: The Godfather raises important questions about morality, family, and the nature of power.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re looking for a film that will stay with you long after you&#39;ve seen it, then The Godfather is a must-watch. It&#39;s a cinematic masterpiece that deserves its place in film history.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 5 out of 5 stars<br/><br/>I hope this review gives you a good sense of why The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films ever made. If you haven&#39;t seen it yet, I urge you to do so. You won&#39;t be disappointed.<br/><br/>Please let me know if you have any other questions about the film. I&#39;m always happy to discuss it further!"

2281,tt0068646,The Godfather,One of the most amazing Movies in the history. Very close to the original source and masterfully done. I believe everyone should check out this masterpiece.
4320,tt0068646,The Godfather,This is many peoples favourite film of all time. Vito Corleone is the Godfather and is the head of a powerful mafia family. Although heavily involved in organised crime the Corleone empire is very much underpinned by trust and honour.<br/><br/>The real story of the Godfather is how Michael changes from being an ordinary citizen with no desire to be involved in the gangster lifestyle to eventually become the head of the family. The catalyst for this is the attempted assassination of Vito during a mafia war caused by Vito&#39;s unwillingness to become involved in drugs.<br/><br/>The acting is quite superb and you shouldn&#39;t forget that Al Pacino was a relative unknown when this was released. Marlon Brando won the best actor award for Vito. The screenplay is superb and like all the best films you become extremely involved with several of the characters. A true classic.
4286,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The best movie that&#39;s showing a journey of boy named Michael, who strongly loved his family which attending business with kind of unique politic, but someday his family in danger because their enemy wanted to take their throne, so Michael learned to protect and succeed.

The acting was good, but Marlon Brando was annoying--his weirdy voice is infamous, but I couldn&#39;t understand anything he said! It sounded very flaccid and emotionless, too.<br/><br/>The story itself seemed very pointless... Michael Corleone kills a bunch of people, mob hits, his father gets shot or something, he becomes the new Godfather or something. Nothing had shown itself much changed or resolved. Didn&#39;t serve a purpose other than to show a bunch of cursing and killing. With thick accents.<br/><br/>The mood was also very very cold-hearted. There&#39;s a general complaint about Steven Spielberg&#39;s &quot;Munich&quot; that it&#39;s very cold, too, that the characters don&#39;t have a warmth to them that you can identify with. &quot;The Godfather&quot; characters are like this too. You can&#39;t identify with any of the characters because they seem so heartless and cold, not even with a hint of charm to them to make you like them, except maybe Marlon Brando, who seemed like a crazy old grandpa who&#39;s half-senile.<br/><br/>I can&#39;t see the classic status of this movie. If it were released today, would it receive the same praise?"
2733,tt0068646,The Godfather,"&quot;The Godfather&quot; is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time. For me, this film is remarkable, as the authors have managed to create an indescribable atmosphere of Sicily and the mores that reigned there. When you watch the film you think that even the smell of streets, herbs and flowers. A magical music does not leave any chances to watch this movie with popcorn. Definitely, a great film! Great director, cinematographer and composer! In addition, it is deeply Sorcerer movie makes you think and analyze life, the finer points of human relations, reveals the true values ​​of life. Great game actors, watching where you wake up in empathy. This is my favorite movie."

5624,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I did n&#39;t understand when I was young, but I was not mature enough at the time. Now it seems that it can indeed be said that it is a man &#39;s Bible.<br/><br/>In the United States in the 1940s, the mafia represented by the godfather Corleone fought openly for the benefit of their families, full of men&#39;s scams and conspiracies.<br/><br/>The godfather Corleone is one of the mafia leaders with political resources. Because he refused to expand the drug business with other mafia, he was excluded by other gangs. People in the family were killed one after another. Corleone was almost killed, but he Always keep to the bottom line of non-drug trafficking. After the death of Corleone, his youngest son, Mike, took over his father&#39;s class. He was calm, cold, and even cold-blooded, and he was vicious, gradually letting the family grow stronger and become the godfather of the new generation.<br/><br/>In the film, the director showed the image of a man who is a godfather. He has good insight and sensitivity. He is concealed, knows to adapt to the current situation, knows the good and evil, and also has a bottom line to take care of the family. It has excellent educational significance for men in troubled times or in today&#39;s peaceful age.<br/><br/>Baunasala &#39;s opening request for help reflects that in the United States in that era, the law and the police did not fully represent justice, and people had to seek the Mafia to provide so-called justice. Even in the face of investigations by federal detectives, the Corleone family did not take them into consideration, because the good relationship between Corleone and politicians made the government not good for them.<br/><br/>Corleone has three sons, a daughter, son-in-law, and an adopted son. The eldest son Sonny is a typical son-in-law, and he doesn&#39;t understand politics and power. Because of his unfriendly attitude towards his sister-in-law, Carlo leads to collusion with the killing of outsiders. The second son, Fredo, was cowardly and became a playboy because of his involvement in the family&#39;s casino business in Las Vegas, but he was still timid. The daughter-in-law had not been planned into the family business, but Carloine killed Sonny and was also killed by his younger son Mike. Mike is Corleone&#39;s favorite son. Through Mike&#39;s composure to deal with the murder of his father in the hospital, the courage to enter the Tiger&#39;s Cave, and the later performance of taking over the family business, it should be most like Corleone. Corleone should be the earliest to see Mike&#39;s potential And he loves him the most, but Corleone did not want Mike to be involved in the family business. Because of the conflict with the drug lord Sorozo&#39;s business, there were too many accidents, and Mike had to take over the family business. Adopted son Tom is also a good player in politics, calm and calm in the event, and is loyal to the business of the Corleone family. The arrangement of &quot;being out&quot; after Mike took over the family business is estimated to let Carlo show the original shape.<br/><br/>After his gunshot wounds improved, even after his son Sonny was killed, Corleone did not concentrate on revenge and did not have full emotional affection. Instead, in exchange for a solution to the conflict, he promised to escort the drug business. This is really not easy. It is not what ordinary politicians can do.<br/><br/>Mike takes good care of his beloved woman, and although he will also find another couple, he will never get rid of flowers. Sometimes she used good faith lies in exchange for her wife &#39;s trust, so that she would not fall into the fear of gangsters.<br/><br/>Movies and books are called men&#39;s bibles, and there are indeed many places that I should study and learn from. However, after all, it is still the Western &quot;Bible&quot;. Our ancestors also have a lot to teach us, which is more worthy of all of us to understand and learn."
2974,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I am 15 at the time of writing this review, and all the movies I have watched made before 1980 I didn&#39;t enjoy. It probably wasn&#39;t the films&#39; fault; it&#39;s just I&#39;m used to movies with realistic CGI effects, HD quality and current actors, but nonetheless I often found the films&#39; quality too grainy to bear and the effects too cheap to appreciate. It was like this for every film until I watched The Godfather. <br/><br/>First of all, for a film made in 1972 its film quality is superb! Also, though I didn&#39;t recognise the actors I knew they were talented. Even the ones not essential to the story. An example of this is the man in the first scene coming to the Godfather for help. His emotions seemed real, and he perfectly delivered his lines in a single, lengthly shot. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie still holds up to this generation, even those like me who generally dislike old movies. It&#39;s the best start to a trilogy that I&#39;ve ever seen!"
184,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought &quot;Yea, I could understand that&quot;. I don&#39;t necessarily agree that it&#39;s absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.<br/><br/>It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. <br/><br/>It&#39;s funny, because I don&#39;t really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.<br/><br/>And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I&#39;d pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it&#39;s spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it&#39;s story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it&#39;s the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. <br/><br/>Stephen King&#39;s novella &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot; was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn&#39;t use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can&#39;t help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. <br/><br/>If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It&#39;s one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.<br/><br/>An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10."
316,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"You are going to need daily motivation to help you overcome all of the obstacles you will face in this line of work. This is the very moment when we feel discouraged and want to give up. This is very inspirational and motivational film,"
5562,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota&#39;s score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando&#39;s raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.<br/><br/>The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it&#39;s more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film&#39;s release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously). There is something deeply resonant in the film&#39;s treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture&#39;s abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia."

The expertly crafted plot, rich character development, and unexpected twists make it a timeless classic that leaves an indelible mark on anyone fortunate enough to watch it.

The story is too tragedy and it keeps you on watching the movie. The story takes you in the movie. They planning is too good! I have seen most of the mafia, police, tragedy and all of the same sort but in my opinion if you compare them to godfather, the highest will get 6/10 while Godfather gets 10/10. The main character of the movie &quot;Don Vito Corleone&quot; looks and act like a proper don. His personality and the way he talks is my favorite. Trust me when you watch the movie remember to notice how he talks and how he plans things. Hes a real G."
2290,tt0068646,The Godfather,"You may have bought into the hype and rightly so, for being made in 1971 it&#39;s pretty solid. The story if halfassed and the acting is mediocre. The voice and over the top Vito Corleone is funny in a sad way. This movie could have easily been cut down to an hour and a half and nothing would have gone awry. You could have guessed everything before it happened, very predictable. I just feel bad for the people saying it&#39;s the greatest movie e ver made. Maybe top 100 but I doubt it. Only older people who were blown away at the time by something entertaining still clutch at this boring waste of time."
2934,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The heavy storyline from &quot;The Godfather&quot; by Mario Puzo couldn&#39;t be better. The best acting performance you poissibly can reach, Marlon Brando does his greatest role ever as Vito. You really don&#39;t notice that the movie has some years on it&#39;s shoulders, stunning by Francis Ford Coppola. This one cannot be anything else than the highest score possible."
2161,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This movie is great in every way. Great plot, great characters, memorable quotes and scenes, and a great representation of the book it&#39;s based on."
3068,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I heard a lot about this movie and very curious about this one and after watching the movie i think it is the most powerful and fulfilling ride one wants.<br/><br/>It starts off very well but these are the turns which make that a wonderful experience. Lots of happening make in interesting and more importantly engaging. I strongly feel that this movie is not for those who do not like the revenge or the other way around about not found of mind games and politics.<br/><br/>Now the hall mark is the acting of Brando which takes this to all time high. Alogn with this, Al Pacino did a well job. But music score of the movie needs a special mention. I still feel that the effect might not be that strong without such hammer strong music.<br/><br/>In the end... just like to say... watch it ... again and again and always you will find something very special."
2666,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I LIKE IT. A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly! This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone&#39;s acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.<br/><br/>From the aspects that have been reviewed, the author states that the film The Godfather truly deserves to be the king of mafia-themed films. The plot is neat and the storyline is not boring. The acting quality of the actors and actresses is not half-hearted. The use of props is also total (that horse&#39;s head, you know!) and also music that suits the theme being carried. If The Shawshank Redemption had never existed, perhaps the one that would be in first place right now would be this film. Two thumbs don&#39;t seem to be enough to appreciate the masterpiece of director Francis and also Mario Puzo as the author of the novel. Salute!"
1764,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I remember distinctly the first time I saw &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television.  Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film.  I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.<br/><br/>The second time I saw the film was in college.  My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted &quot;The Godfather&quot; as the finest film.  One evening my friend and I watched the film.  The viewing once again left me unimpressed.  I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation.  Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a &quot;good movie&quot; when I saw one.<br/><br/>Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare.  I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed &quot;The Godfather&quot; again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants.  Well, I think you know the outcome.  As they say in baseball, three strikes and you&#39;re out.<br/><br/>I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way.  I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow.  There is no moral center.<br/><br/>I do not demand that a movie have morality.  I do not demand that a film even have a point.  I can take a film at its face value for what it is.  A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire.  The problem is that &quot;The Godfather&quot; aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.<br/><br/>Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film&#39;s philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza.  However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst.  We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man&#39;s foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it.  Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.<br/><br/>Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather&#39; as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men.  But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous.  To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that many of those who claim &quot;The Godfather&quot; as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the &quot;fans&quot; I know.  A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD &quot;Godfather&quot; collection that he received for Christmas.  As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it?  That is faint praise indeed for the &quot;greatest film of all time&quot;.<br/><br/>I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie.  I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a paper tiger."
3652,tt0068646,The Godfather,This movie is my favorite all the times.I have seen its all three parts repeatedly.
5063,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I&#39;m unusual in that I<br/><br/>1) read the Mario Puzo novel in it&#39;s entirety prior to seeing the original film in the early 1970s<br/><br/>2) I saw the film in first run theatrical release when I was 12 or 13.<br/><br/>3) my initial reaction was comparing the film to the book.<br/><br/>But time went on, and I rewatched this film many times, and I began to see this film, and indeed, the book, in a very different light, the light of the struggle of ethnic immigrants from Southern Europe to make it in an America that was ostensibly equal to all, but in reality discriminated against Jews, Italians, Greeks, Armenians, et al.<br/><br/>Family, Clan, blood feud, take care of your family first, these were themes that resonated with me quite strongly as I rewatched this film.<br/><br/>&quot;A man, to be a man, must have family,&quot; says Don Corleone in the powerful opening scene. The ritual of being godparents is powerful in the Catholic &amp; Eastern Christian churches in a way not understood well by American Protestants.<br/><br/>Ostensibly a movie about the Mafia, but really a show about Family, and loyalty to family.<br/><br/>One of my very favorite films."
658,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"The first time I saw this movie I loved it. But I loved it more and more every time I saw it again. If you want to have a good and entertaining time watching a movie, buy this movie."
5382,tt0068646,The Godfather,The Godfather is an evergreen movie that can be watched anywhere and anytime.
4890,tt0068646,The Godfather,"It feels that the movie skipped and adapted so much stuff, which makes it even harder to understand. Might want to read the book."
4266,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Just watched it again for the 15th time or so. Still in 2011 you cannot notice the fact it was made almost 30 years ago.<br/><br/>Incredible strong directing, acting and writing...<br/><br/>The DoP is a master, gaffers magicians....<br/><br/>A nice touch is that the movie is set in the 40&#39;s and so some acting is done exactly as they did in that time-frame of the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s which makes it even more believable.<br/><br/>I have watched it really carefully to notice any mistakes in time-settings, but could not find any. Also looking at Al Pacino trying to put his face to his later role as Scarface, i had problems putting Michael Corleone&#39;s face to that of Scarface, such different acting was used .<br/><br/>Bravo...."
48,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I was finally forced to watch this &#39;masterpiece&#39;.  What, exactly, is the redeeming feature of this movie that all these film &#39;elites&#39; love so much.<br/><br/>It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story?  Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.<br/><br/>This movie has no business being so well-liked and shows what is wrong with both American cimema and the IMDB ranking system."
2892,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This is a marvelous work, it cannot be better than that"
1994,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Coppola&#39;s masterpiece is the greatest movie ever made in my opinion. The actors are amazing, the roles are fit perfect to the actors, the plot is fantastic, and the music.... that music is perfect, it is terrifying, and give you goosebumps, and fit absolutely to the depressing moments of the The Godfather. I recommend this movie to everyone who can appreciate the pleasure of the movie arts."
1190,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I really enjoyed the movie .<br/><br/>I really was a little bit bored at the first hour and how things get a little bit too much the same thing but everything accelerate after .<br/><br/>So we follow two guys charged for murder and both of them live in prison . And we see what happened and how they try to stay strong despite the problems . We know that Dufresne was not guilty but it get there anyway .<br/><br/>And the life in prison is a little bit boring but what i really enjoyed are these relationship moments and how they stay together with jokes and they helped each other like a family .<br/><br/>Dufresne got a chance to maybe clear his name by a testimony but the director of prison is corrupt and they killed the guy who could save Andy and it was shocking and we felt that injustice .<br/><br/>But the big moment its when we know that Andy had made a holemto get out of prison and it was unexpected . We felt like Ellis ( the funny thing is that from the beginning Ellis seemed to know everything and when he get worried about Dufresne that he could do something wrong we get the same worries ) so yeah we get fooled in some ways and that freedom moment in the rain was very well made .<br/><br/>Friendship,injustice,Justice are some big themes in that movie . And i really love that they talked about the life before prison and after too . The talk about some prisoners who cant get used to society anymore because they have been in another condition that dont fit in that kind of living so we see the death of that old man and the redemption of Ellis who moved on in life with a new business and project with Dufresne and i really like that opposition of fate about Ellis and the old man . And reinforce that friendhsip was really important .<br/><br/>A very nice movie and keep up until the end : you will get surprised about how things turned and about some dialogues who have another meaning ."
4923,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather movie is the best cinema movie and it made me love watching cinema because of my love for this movie. I thank every actor for this artistic masterpiece And I would like to write this article to express my love for watching this movie. It is the best film made. I love watching it. I love the actor Al Pacino. He is talented. I thank the director for producing a movie in this format. I hope people will accept my opinion. And they know how much I love watching the movie, and I liked every performance of the actors, such as Michael. In the end, I hope that you will accept my opinion and my point of view. Thank you."
2609,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The power of cinema at its purest and most vivid expression. Screenplay, direction, cinematography, acting, editing, it all comes in the most elevated form. Francis Ford Coppola is a craftsman, as every director and artist should be, that draws inspiration from the power of the words and of the actions of characters and provides the standard upon which all the following history of cinema relies. It&#39;s an historic work of art."
2865,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think &quot;The Godfather&quot; and in particular Marlon Brando&#39;s performance are completely over rated. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a bad movie at all, it&#39;s a good one, but I don&#39;t think it lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather &quot;Don&quot; Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito&#39;s old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.<br/><br/>I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it. <br/><br/>With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don&#39;t mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in &quot;Rocky&quot;) and Diane Keaton. <br/><br/>Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It&#39;s just over rated"
5727,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I have to say that there is no movie to watch, even godfather. However, when you have to shut your mouth, because no one wants to hear it, you have to dry your blood and tears, because no one cares, at this time, go and see godfather, because he is worth it. If you want to find a movie to witness your life and eliminate your nothingness, then choose godfather, because it is worth it. People all say that Godfather is the &quot;Man&#39;s Bible&quot; that men must read, but I can&#39;t tell my father this evaluation, and how childish and ridiculous it is to say it. Taking godfather as a necessity for men or a shortcut for men is actually not praising this movie, but belittling it."
4550,tt0068646,The Godfather,"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing. The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. It&#39;s awesome.This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well."
4694,tt0068646,The Godfather,"I loved the plot,characters, everything about it was amazing. This movie is very iconic!"
4477,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Well, after reading the other comments I can only conclude that I have nothing to add. This is the best movie ever made. I can recite what others have said, but I won&#39;t. Thank God he created everybody who has helped making this film. And to the one person on this world, who didn&#39;t like it: Sorry for you, you&#39;re life won&#39;t be complete."
5163,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Don&#39;t hate your enemy, it will affect your judgment."
3676,tt0068646,The Godfather,"Simply put, this movie is the oracle, answer key, the blue print, for all mafia films.  There has never been a better mob movie, and there never will. Goodfellas comes pretty close, but The Godfather and Godfather II are the mold that Goodfellas was made from.<br/><br/>I first saw this film in 1983, 11 years after it was released.  I&#39;d heard about it, but VCRs weren&#39;t quite common household items back then.  I had a cinema class in high school, and to view this film, the teachers got us out of all our classes for a day and showed The Godfather on the big screen in the school auditorium.  So I was fortunate to see it for the first time in a crowded theatre on a big screen.<br/><br/>Afterwards, the entire class asked for the movie to be shown again in place of one of the other films we were due to see.  They offered to play it after school in the evening for us instead.  The whole class turned out the second time plus another 100 to 150 tag-alongs.<br/><br/>This movie is full of fantastic performances from top to bottom. To try to convey how great this film is in words is almost silly.  It has to be seen."
1185,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"When you lose hope in everything, When your world narrowing on you and you think that is no point of keep going, when you feel unfairness, punished and you&#39;re innocent, then i advise you to watch this movie, it&#39;s a truly masterpiece ! <br/><br/>This Movie is on the summit of cinema top movies of all time (well i didn&#39;t feel okay with that , sure it&#39;s an amazing movie, But on the top !! i&#39;ll be let that to another discuss).<br/><br/>a word - Movie - is very small for this immortal work, the film carries a lot of humans values and great life lessons, all that in a worse possible place which is prison .. Yeah Shawshank Prison !! Also that movie highlights and explain more things such as : patience, hope, friendship, Treason, Love, Injustice, everything was excellent on this movie started from cast to script until directing which was brilliant and almost perfect.<br/><br/>I want to recommend this movie BUT ... Who has not been seen This Masterpiece &lt;3 !!"
710,tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,"I am so happy to see this film top 1 in IMDb. It deserves to be there. &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; appears in 1994, I think this year was full of amazing pictures. It lost Oscars but gained recognition. This is a great story about friendship and redemption. Frank Darabont&#39;s best movie for sure. Andy Dufresne is one of the greatest characters ever made in the cinema art. A guy who is innocent and get punished. This film shows us that even our intention is a crime in a legal world. No one is perfect, and no one can predict anything. We live by a scheme and trying to be fair. People will always make mistakes and the greatest thing is to learn from them. I am waiting for movies which can touch me like this one but after the year 2000 nothing close to that appears. There were great films about life and stuff but still, it&#39;s a modification, a copy thereof what was before. I think until the year 2000 most of the valuable things in film art was told. It&#39;s a little sad but this kind of art will always be deep in my heart as a lesson and beauty how fantastic picture man create. I hope there will be at least couple movies in my short life that leave so many emotions like &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;. In XXI century it is a very hard thing to do. I am patient and have positive thinking that cinema didn&#39;t say the last words."
3312,tt0068646,The Godfather,"This was a classic, and a very good film. It felt like the end game of the sopranos (just not done as well). I do not agree with everyone that says this is the greatest movie of all time (people also say citizen kane, or Shawshank is the greatest movie of all time), I just didn&#39;t enjoy the movie. The biggest problem with the movie is the pacing, which is overly slow. I still love this movie! I think it&#39;s funny that marlan brando put cotton balls in his cheeks for this role. This movie was fine."
