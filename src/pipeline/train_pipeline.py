"""
Placeholder for a future end-to-end training pipeline.

The current project uses:
- `src/components/data_ingestion.py` and `src/components/data_transformation.py`
  to build transformed datasets.
- `src/components/model_trainer.py` to train and evaluate traditional ML models.

If you want a single CLI entry point that orchestrates ingestion, transformation,
and model training, you can implement it here.
